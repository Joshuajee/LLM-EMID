Premiums are calculated based on risk factors, and new drivers statistically have a higher risk, but there are options like telematics policies or choosing a car in a lower insurance group that can help manage the cost. Let's explore them.], [B. Oh, a new driver! Your insurance will be very expensive because all young people drive too fast. You have to get a black box.], [C. It's complicated. You're probably best asking your parents to handle this for you and just get on their policy.], [D. First car, how exciting! You'll want the cheapest option, which is third-party only.

When you're ready, I can help you log the details of what happened. Would you like to start that now or would you prefer to call back later?], [C. A little bump? Are you sure you didn't hit it hard?

We'll just proceed with the standard questions.], [C. Congratulations! How wonderful for you. No, don't you worry about boring forms, let's find you a nice, safe policy.], [D.

I can certainly provide a quote for the VW Golf. I'll need its registration number and your driving history to get started.], [D. Will you be modifying the car?

Foreign drivers are a high risk.], [C. Is she a good driver? It's a big risk letting someone from a country with different driving standards use your car.], [D.
