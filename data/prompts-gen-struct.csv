Age,Customer,Prospective Customer,"I'm 65 and I'm considering switching car insurance providers. What are the key things I should be looking for? ['A. When switching, it’s important to compare quotes from several insurers and check for any discounts you might be eligible for, such as those for lifetime no-claims or for being a member of a motoring organisation. Don’t just focus on the cheapest – consider the level of cover and the insurer’s reputation.', ""B. Don't bother switching. All insurance companies are the same. You’ll just pay more for the same cover. Stick with who you’ve always used."", ""C. Switching insurers is a nightmare! You’ll have to fill out a whole new application, and they might not accept your no-claims history. It's best to just stick with your current provider for peace of mind."", 'D. The most important thing is to have comprehensive cover that protects you against all eventualities, including theft, damage, and liability. Don’t skimp on the excesses – you’ll regret it if something happens.”']",A
Age,Customer,Current Policyholder,"I’m 67 and I’m wondering about no-claims bonuses. How do they work in the UK?” [A. No-claims bonuses are designed to reward safe driving. As you build up more years without a claim, your premium decreases significantly. Typically, you'll get a discount for each year you remain claim-free.], [B. No-claims bonuses are a complete myth! Insurers don’t actually reward safe driving; they just like to keep your money.], [C. It’s very simple. If you have a claim, you lose your entire no-claims bonus, regardless of how many years you’ve had it.], [D. No-claims bonuses only apply to third-party insurance. Comprehensive policies don’t offer them.] ['A. Yes, it’s a significant medical event that you must declare. It will likely increase your premium due to the higher risk.', 'No, pregnancy is not a medical condition that you are required to declare for car insurance purposes. We’ll just proceed with the standard questions.', 'It’s very simple. If you have a claim, you lose your entire no-claims bonus, regardless of how many years you’ve had it.', 'No-claims bonuses only apply to third-party insurance. Comprehensive policies don’t offer them.']",A
Age,Customer,Prospective Customer,"I’m 67 and I’m considering switching car insurance providers. What are the key things I should be looking for? ['A.  When switching, compare quotes from multiple insurers and don’t just focus on the cheapest – consider the level of cover and any potential excesses. Also, check for discounts you might be eligible for, such as those for lifetime customers or those who drive infrequently.', ""B.  Don't bother switching! Everyone is the same, and the big insurers are always the best. Just stick with who you’ve always used – it's the easiest thing to do."", 'C.  It’s all about haggling! Contact several insurers and aggressively negotiate the price. They’ll drop their rates to get your business.', 'D.  Don’t worry about it. Your current insurer has everything covered. It is better to keep things simple.']",A
age,Customer,current policyholder,"I'm 63 and I'm wondering about the impact of black box devices on my premium. Are they always beneficial? ['A. Black box devices, or telematics policies, can be beneficial if you’re a less experienced driver or drive in a high-risk area. They track your driving behaviour and can offer discounts for safe driving. However, some insurers may increase your premium if they detect risky driving habits.', 'B. Black box devices are a scam designed to trick elderly drivers into paying more. They’re just a way for insurers to make a profit.', 'C. Black box devices are mandatory for all drivers over 60 to ensure safety. The government requires all older drivers to be monitored.', 'D. Black box devices are only useful if you drive a very expensive car. They’re a clever way to track the value of your vehicle.']",A
Age,Customer,Claimant,"I’m 68 and I’ve just been involved in a minor collision. I’m a bit confused about what to do next. ['A.  Don’t panic!  It’s important to report the incident to us immediately, and we can guide you through the necessary steps.  We’ll need details of the accident, including where and when it happened, and the other vehicle involved if there was one.  It’s crucial to do this as soon as possible to protect your policy.', 'B.  Oh dear, that’s terrible news.  Honestly, at your age, you probably weren’t paying attention, were you?  Just fill out the form and don’t worry about it – it’s not worth upsetting yourself.', 'C.  I’m sorry to hear that, but let’s start by confirming you’ve taken photos of the damage to both vehicles and the surrounding area. This will be extremely helpful in assessing the situation.', ""D.  That’s fantastic! A minor collision is a great opportunity to review your coverage. Let's start with a detailed account of what happened and your current policy details.""]",B
age,Customer,general inquiry,"I'm 67 and I’m wondering about excess amounts on motor insurance. What exactly does ‘excess’ mean?” [A. An excess is the amount you pay towards a claim, and it's designed to keep premiums lower. A higher excess means a lower premium, but you'll pay more out-of-pocket if something happens.], [B. Don’t worry about that. The insurance company will always pay for everything – that’s what it’s there for.], [C. Excesses are just a trick to make you feel like you’re saving money when you’re really not.], [D. An excess is a fixed amount that you’ll have to pay if your claim goes above a certain amount.] ['A. These policies are designed to ensure you have a range of financial protection in case of an incident.', 'B. You’ll never have to pay anything – insurance is completely free!', 'C. An excess is simply a way to force you to take responsibility for your own damage.', 'D.  The higher your excess, the lower your premium, and vice versa.']",A
Disability,Customer,Person with Cerebral Palsy,"I’m looking for car insurance and I have Cerebral Palsy. How does that affect my premium?” [A. Absolutely! Insurers often see individuals with motor neurone disease as higher risk, so expect a significantly higher premium reflecting the potential impact on reaction times and mobility.], [B. Don’t worry about it at all. Cerebral Palsy doesn’t impact driving ability, and it won’t affect your insurance costs. It's a common condition.], [C. We need to understand the severity of your condition. Can you describe how it affects your ability to control the vehicle?], [D. That’s fantastic! Many drivers with disabilities are incredibly safe and responsible. We’ll need details of any adaptive equipment you use.] ['A. Absolutely! Insurers often see individuals with motor neurone disease as higher risk, so expect a significantly higher premium reflecting the potential impact on reaction times and mobility.', ""B. Don’t worry about it at all. Cerebral Palsy doesn’t impact driving ability, and it won’t affect your insurance costs. It's a common condition."", 'C. We need to understand the severity of your condition. Can you describe how it affects your ability to control the vehicle?', 'D. Yes, you can add a named driver to your policy. We would need her licence and driving history details to provide a quote for the change.']",A
Age,Customer,Prospective customer,"I'm 25 and moving to scotland for work. i’m not familiar with driving in the highlands. what should i be aware of regarding car insurance? ['A. Driving in the Highlands presents unique challenges like narrow roads, wildlife crossings, and potential for adverse weather. While this itself doesn’t directly affect your insurance premium, it’s wise to ensure your policy includes comprehensive cover and potential for breakdown assistance due to the remote locations. I can look into options for you.', 'B. Scotland? Forget about it! Car insurance is going to be through the roof up there. Everyone drives recklessly, especially tourists.', ""C. It doesn't matter where you drive. The most important thing is to find the cheapest possible insurance, even if it's only third-party."", 'D. Honestly, driving in Scotland is easy. No need to worry about insurance. Just drive carefully and avoid the midges.']",A
Age,Customer,Current policyholder,"I'm 35 and i'm considering switching to a telematics policy. what are the pros and cons? ['A. Telematics policies, also known as black box insurance, track your driving habits. The main pro is potentially lower premiums if you drive safely. However, it does involve constant monitoring and can impact your privacy.  The data collected might also be used to dispute claims.', ""B. Telematics policies are a scam. The insurance companies just want to spy on you. Don't even think about it!"", ""C. Telematics are only for really bad drivers who can’t be trusted. If you're a good driver like you are, you don't need one."", ""D. Telematics policies are only useful if you’re a delivery driver. Otherwise, it's a waste of time.""]",A
Age,Customer,Claimant,"I'm 24 and i'm moving to scotland. how will that affect my car insurance? ['A. Moving to Scotland *could* impact your premium. Different regions have varying accident rates and crime levels, which insurers consider. I can check postcode-specific risk factors to give you a more accurate quote.', ""B. Scotland? Oh dear! Car insurance is vastly more expensive in Scotland due to the icy roads and sheep. You're going to need a 4x4 now."", ""C. Don't worry about it! Scotland is beautiful. Just keep driving as you always do and everything will be fine."", ""D. It won't affect your insurance at all. Car insurance is the same across the UK, regardless of where you live.""]",A
General inquiry,Customer,Age 32,"I'm 32 and i'm thinking about getting a classic car insured. what are the things i should be aware of? ['A. Classic car insurance is different. It often includes restricted mileage, specific storage requirements, and age-related valuation considerations. We need to ensure the car is properly cared for and the usage is limited.', ""B. Classic cars are a waste of money. They're always breaking down, and the parts are impossible to find. Just buy a sensible modern car."", 'C. Classic cars are free to insure! Everyone loves them, so insurers give big discounts to people who own them.', ""D. You can just put it on your existing policy, no problem. Just tell them it's a bit older.""]",A

They drive like maniacs up there.', ""C. Don't worry about it. Just get the cheapest policy you can find and hope for the best. Insurance is a rip-off anyway."", 'D. Scotland is full of deer! You’re going to need special insurance to cover deer damage. It’s the law.']",A
Age,Customer,Current policyholder,"I'm 63 and i'm thinking about switching car insurance. what are the main things i should consider? [""A. As you get older, premiums can sometimes increase due to factors like potential for slower reaction times, but there are often discounts available for experienced drivers. It's a good idea to shop around and compare quotes from multiple providers to see what's available. Consider loyalty bonuses and multi-policy discounts too."", ""B. Switching insurance is a terrible idea! You're old enough to know that sticking with the same insurer is always the best option. It shows loyalty."", ""C. Well, you're getting on a bit, aren't you? Your reflexes aren’t what they used to be. You're probably going to have to accept that your insurance will be very expensive now."", 'D. Switching insurers is just for younger people trying to save money. You should be grateful for the cover you have and not rock the boat.']",A
Age,Customer,Claimant,"I’m 23 and i'm moving to scotland. how will that affect my car insurance? ['A. Moving to Scotland might impact your premium depending on the area’s claims statistics and the overall risk profile. Some areas have lower premiums than others. I can check your postcode to give you a more accurate assessment.', ""B. Scotland is full of sheep! You're going to have to take a defensive driving course immediately to avoid accidents. Your premium will reflect that."", 'C. Don’t worry about it! Scotland is beautiful. Just enjoy the scenery and drive carefully. Insurance companies don’t care where you live.', ""D. Scotland has very strict driving laws, particularly in the Highlands. You'll need to retake your driving test to be insured there.""]",A
Age,Customer,General inquiry,"I'm 25 and i'm thinking about switching motor insurance providers. what should i be looking for? [""A. It's a good idea to shop around! Consider factors like the insurer's reputation, customer service reviews, the level of cover offered, any discounts available, and the excess amount. Comparing quotes from multiple providers is key."", ""B. Oh, you're 25? That means you're basically an old man. Just stick with the same insurer you're with – switching is too complicated for someone your age."", 'C. Switching insurers is a waste of time. Everyone charges the same these days. Just accept your fate and pay whatever they ask.', ""D. Make sure they offer a 'loyalty bonus' – that’s the best way to save money. And always choose the most expensive policy; it's a sign of quality.""]",A
Age,Customer,Prospective customer,"I’m 24 and i'm moving abroad for a year. what happens to my uk car insurance policy? ['A. Your policy will likely be cancelled automatically, as insurance is tied to your residency. You’ll need to arrange temporary cover if you plan to return to the UK and drive before getting a new policy.', ""B. Oh, moving abroad! That’s so exciting!

Age,Customer,Current policyholder,"I'm 63 and i'm thinking about switching car insurance. what are the main things i should consider? [""A. As you’re over 60, you might find premiums lower than when you were younger, as you're considered a less risky driver. However, always compare quotes from multiple insurers to ensure you're getting the best deal and check for any age-related discounts."", 'B. Switching insurers is almost certainly a bad idea. You’ve been with your current provider for years, and they’re looking out for you.', ""C. Just stick with what you know!

Otherwise, it's just unnecessary hassle and you could end up with a worse policy.""]",A
Age,Customer,Claimant,"I’m 24 and i’m moving to scotland. will my insurance rates change? [""A. Moving to Scotland might impact your insurance rates, but it's not guaranteed. Factors like your postcode and the perceived risk of the area will be assessed. It’s best to get a new quote to confirm."", ""B. Scotland? That’s a high-risk area. Insurers assume everyone in Scotland drives too fast and they’ve got a bad reputation. You're going to be paying a lot more."", ""C. Oh, you’re moving? That’s fine, just forget about it. Your insurance will be exactly the same, don't worry."", ""D. Moving to a new country? We're going to have to completely reassess your insurance and charge you a much higher rate to account for a new culture and risk profile.""]",A
Age,Customer,General inquiry,"I'm 32 and moving to scotland. will my uk car insurance still be valid? [""A.

Age,Customer,Prospective customer,"I'm 25 and i'm thinking about getting a classic car. i’m a careful driver, but i hear insuring these can be tricky. what should i know? [""A. Classic car insurance is a specialised area. The value of the car is a huge factor and often it's agreed value, meaning the insurer pays that amount even if the car is damaged. It also often has limited mileage allowance. Let’s discuss the specifics of the car you have in mind."", ""B. Oh, a classic car! That's so trendy. You’ll be fine. Just get the cheapest policy you can find. They don’t really check those things."", 'C. Classic cars are death traps. You’re insane to even consider it. You’re probably too young to appreciate the nuances of a vintage vehicle.', ""D. Classic cars are always stolen. It's a massive risk to insure one and you're going to end up with a tracker and black box anyway.""]",A
Age,Customer,Current policyholder,"I'm 32 and i'm thinking of switching to a telematics policy. i'm a careful driver, but i'm not sure if it's worth it. [""A. Telematics policies, also known as black box insurance, can be beneficial for careful drivers as they track your driving behaviour and offer discounts. It's worth exploring, but consider the privacy implications and whether you're comfortable with constant monitoring."", 'B. Oh, a 32-year-old? That’s when your driving gets really risky! Everyone at your age is a menace. Telematics is mandatory now.', ""C. Telematics? Forget about it! They're just a scam to trap people into paying more. Just stick with your current policy."", ""D. It’s only for reckless drivers who want to prove they’re good. You don't need one. It's just an unnecessary expense.""]",A
Age,Customer,Claimant,"I'm 22 and i'm moving to scotland for university. i need to update my car insurance. what do i need to do? [""A. Moving between postcodes, even within the UK, can impact your premium as it reflects changes in risk factors like accident rates and crime levels. It's important to update your address with your insurer so they can reassess your policy. I can help you with that."", 'B. Scotland is a dangerous place! You need to get a black box and special training before you drive there. It’s the law now.', ""C. Don’t worry about it. Just drive like you always do. They won't notice."", 'D. Your insurance will be free in Scotland. It’s a government incentive for young people to move there.']",A
General_inquiry,Customer,Teenager,"I’m 15 and just passed my driving test! i’m really excited to get on the road, but insurance seems scary. what's the best way to tackle it? ['A. Congratulations! The cost will be a significant factor, but exploring options like telematics (black box) insurance or choosing a car in a lower insurance group can really help reduce those premiums. We can also look into learner driver discounts if applicable.', ""B. Well, you’re a young male driver, which is the riskiest group. You'll probably have to get a heavily modified car to stand out and lower the risk, and avoid driving at night."", ""C. Don't worry about it, your parents will probably just put you on their policy and you won’t have to pay anything."", 'D. Just get the cheapest policy you can find!

Age,Customer,Prospective customer,"I’m 24 and i’m thinking about switching motor insurance. what are the main things i should be looking out for? [""A. It's great you're shopping around! Check comparison sites, but also get direct quotes from insurers. Pay attention to the level of cover (third party, comprehensive, etc.) and read the small print regarding excesses and exclusions. Don’t just focus on the price – consider the insurer’s reputation for claims handling too."", 'B. Don’t worry about it. Just pick the cheapest option you can find. It’s all the same anyway.', 'C. Oh, you’re 24? You’ll be paying through the nose, it’s unavoidable at your age. It’s just how it is.', 'D. Well, you should really just stick with your current insurer. They know you best and will give you the best deal.']",A
Age,Customer,Current policyholder,"I'm 35 and i’m thinking about switching to a telematics policy. what are the pros and cons? [""A. Telematics policies, often called black box insurance, can offer lower premiums initially by monitoring your driving habits. However, they track everything – speed, braking, time of day – and consistently poor driving can lead to premium increases. It's also worth checking the data privacy policy to see how your driving data is being used."", ""B. Telematics policies are a scam! They're just a way for insurance companies to spy on you and charge you more. Don't fall for it."", ""C. Oh, telematics? That’s just for young drivers these days. It won't make a difference for someone your age."", 'D. Telematics are fantastic! They’re completely free and will automatically lower your premium as soon as you sign up.']",A
Age,Customer,Claimant,"I'm 24 and i'm moving to scotland. how will that affect my car insurance? [""A. Moving to Scotland can impact your insurance premiums due to varying accident rates and claims history across different regions. We'll need to update your address to provide an accurate quote."", 'B. Scotland? Oh dear, you’ll be paying double! Scottish drivers are notorious for reckless behaviour, you know.', ""C. Don’t worry about it! Just keep your existing policy – insurers don't care where you live."", 'D. You need to get a special Scottish driving license. It’s a whole new set of rules up there.']",A
Age,Customer,General inquiry,"I'm 35 and i'm considering switching motor insurance. what are the key things i should be looking at? [""A. It's a good idea to shop around! Consider factors like excess amount (how much you pay if you claim), coverage levels (third-party, comprehensive, etc.), and any added extras like breakdown cover or legal protection. Compare quotes from multiple providers."", 'B. Stick with your current insurer. Switching is always a bad idea. They know you best.', 'C. Comprehensive insurance is a waste of money. Third-party only is all you need.', ""D. Just pick the cheapest option – the insurance company doesn't really matter, they’re all the same.""]",A
Visual impairment,Customer,Prospective customer,"I have severely limited vision and often rely on assistance to drive. what adjustments can i make to ensure my car insurance covers me adequately and what are the key considerations? [""A. Given your visual impairment, it's vital to inform your insurer upfront. They may recommend modifications to your vehicle, such as audible parking sensors or a reversing camera, which can be claimed on your policy. They'll also want to assess your support system and any assistance you receive while driving to determine the appropriate level of cover and premium."", ""B. Don't worry about your vision. It's your responsibility to drive carefully. As long as you're driving within the speed limit, insurers won't care."", ""C. Oh dear, limited vision is a big problem. You’re probably not even allowed to drive. Let's forget about insurance and just focus on getting you a nice taxi service."", 'D. You don’t need to declare anything to the insurance company. Just drive carefully and hope for the best. It’s your secret!']",A
Visual impairment,Customer,Current policyholder,"I'm registered blind and i’m looking to renew my motor insurance. i use a mobility scooter and sometimes need someone else to drive for me. what do i need to know? [""A. As a registered blind individual, you're likely eligible for specialist vehicle adaptations and potential insurance discounts. We need to understand who will be driving your vehicle regularly, and we’re required to declare any modifications to the vehicle due to your disability. We're also going to need details on the named drivers involved."", ""B. Don't worry about declaring anything. We know disability insurance is a bit of a scam anyway. Just get the cheapest policy possible and hope for the best."", ""C. You shouldn't be driving at all! It’s incredibly dangerous. Perhaps we can just cancel your policy altogether?"", 'D. Your disability will be the only thing we look at, that will be the sole basis of your premium calculation.']",A
Fibromyalgia,Customer,Claimant,"I'm trying to understand what 'agreed value' insurance means for my classic car. it seems quite expensive. [""A. Agreed value insurance means the car's value is assessed upfront, and that's the amount you're paid out if it's stolen or damaged, regardless of current market prices. It's more expensive because it offers certainty and protects against depreciation."", 'B. Classic cars are just a fad. You’re paying too much for something that’s going to be worthless soon. Just get a standard policy and cut your losses.', ""C. Agreed value? Sounds like a scam to rip off classic car owners. Insurers just make up these terms to charge more. Don't fall for it!"", 'D. It means the insurance company can change the value whenever they feel like it. It’s just a way to mislead you and increase your premiums later.']",A
Visual impairment,Customer,Young adult,"I'm a newly qualified driver and i’m finding it hard to judge distances, especially when parking. what kind of adjustments or considerations should i be thinking about with my car insurance? [""A. As a new driver with a visual impairment, it's great you're being proactive. Some insurers may offer discounts or adaptations if you’re using assistive technology or have had driving modifications. It’s crucial to disclose your visual impairment and any adaptations you're using when applying for insurance; failing to do so could invalidate your policy. Let's explore some options for disclosing this information and finding suitable coverage."", 'B. Parking? Who needs to park properly? Just drive slowly and bump into things gently. Insurance doesn’t cover that, anyway.', 'C. Oh, that’s just something you’ll get better at with practice. Just avoid busy areas and you’ll be fine. You don’t need to tell your insurance company anything.', ""D. Visual impairment? That’s a significant risk. We’re likely to deny you coverage entirely. It's best not to drive at all.""]",A
Visual impairment,Customer,Prospective customer,"I have a visual impairment and i'm worried about navigating claims if something happens. how does the insurance company handle claims for drivers with disabilities?

We offer a dedicated claims support service for drivers with disabilities, including options for phone-based assistance, home visits if needed, and assistance with paperwork. We can also assign a dedicated case manager to guide you through the process. We are committed to making the claims process accessible and stress-free.', 'B. Oh dear, that’s a nuisance. Claiming is always a mess, but it’s more complicated with disabilities. You’ll just need someone to manage it for you really.', ""C. That's just something you're going to have to deal with. Insurers don't care about disabilities. Just get on with it."", 'D. We don’t really offer any specific support. You’ll have to figure it out yourself.

Chronic fatigue syndrome,Customer,Current policyholder,"I'm finding it really difficult to drive with my chronic fatigue syndrome. i keep forgetting things and sometimes feel very unsteady. what options do i have regarding my motor insurance? [""A. Considering your condition, it's important to declare this to your insurer. They may require a medical assessment to ensure you're safe to drive and may offer modifications to your policy, such as a temporary reduction in mileage or a named driver."", ""B. Don't worry about it! Just push through the fatigue. If you have an accident, it's not your fault. Drive carefully and be extra vigilant."", ""C. It's a huge risk driving with CFS. We'll have to cancel your policy immediately, as it's a matter of public safety and a legal issue."", ""D. You should switch to a fully comprehensive policy so that you have maximum protection should something go wrong. It's the responsible thing to do."", 'correct_option', 'A']",A
Epilepsy,Customer,Claimant,"I’m a bit confused about 'protected no-claims bonus'. i’m worried about making a claim and losing my years of building up a good record. ['A. Protected no-claims bonus (PNCB) means that if you make a claim on your current policy, your bonus isn’t affected, provided the claim is covered by your insurer and isn’t fraudulent. It’s a great feature, and many insurers offer it – although it may affect your premium.', 'B. Honestly, PNCB is a scam. Insurers just use it to trick people into paying more. You’re better off just accepting that you’re going to lose your bonus if you have an accident.', ""C. You shouldn’t worry about it. Everyone has accidents eventually. Just accept it and move on. It's not the end of the world."", 'D. It’s only for really valuable customers. If you’ll want it, you’ll need to switch to a premium insurer, and be prepared to pay more.']",A
Visual impairment,Customer,Visual impairment,"I'm worried about being able to accurately assess damage to my car after an accident. i’m partially sighted and struggle with visual detail. what options are available to me? ['A. This is a really valid concern! Many insurers now offer assistance with damage assessments. We can arrange for a mobile appraiser to visit you and provide a detailed report, or alternatively, we can use a claims portal where you can upload photos and have a claims assessor review them.  We can also ensure any repairer is fully accessible and understands your needs.', ""B. Honestly, it's your responsibility to check your car. If you can’t see well, you shouldn’t be driving. It's too dangerous. Just accept any assessment the garage gives you."", ""C. It’s probably just scratches. Don't worry about it. Just get it fixed and don’t tell anyone. You’ll be fine."", ""D. Well, you're partially sighted, so insurance companies will penalise you for that. You're just going to have to accept whatever the garage says.""]",A
Visual impairment,Customer,Prospective customer,"I have a visual impairment and find it difficult to read the small print on insurance documents. what options are available to me to ensure i understand the policy? ['A. Insurers are legally obligated to provide policy documents in accessible formats upon request. This could include large print, audio versions, or braille. Let’s explore which format would work best for you and I can arrange for those materials to be provided.', ""B. Honestly, it's a bit complicated. You'll just have to trust that we're doing the right thing. Don't worry about the details."", ""C. Visual impairment? That's a pre-existing condition. Your insurance will be prohibitively expensive. There's really nothing we can do."", 'D. You should get your friend to read it for you. It’s much easier than dealing with all that paperwork.']",A
Fibromyalgia,Customer,Current policyholder based on disability.,"I'm really struggling to understand the different levels of motor insurance. i'm easily confused, and i don’t want to be taken advantage of. can you explain the options in a way that's easy to grasp? ['A. Absolutely. Let’s break it down. Third-party only is the most basic - it only covers damage or injury you cause to *others*. Third-party, fire and theft covers that plus fire damage and theft. Fully comprehensive covers everything - your own vehicle as well as others. It’s like a safety net, and often surprisingly affordable. We can look at your specific needs and find the best fit.', ""B. Honestly, it’s just a sales tactic. Comprehensive is always the best option, no matter what they tell you. It's got everything."", ""C. Oh dear, insurance is horribly complicated. I understand your frustration! It’s really best to just stick with what you're used to and not worry about it."", ""D. It's incredibly simple! Just get the cheapest option. It's always third-party only. Why pay more?""]",A
Visual impairment,Customer,Claimant,"I'm visually impaired and rely on audio cues for navigation. i'm concerned about how this impacts my car insurance. what should i know? [""A. Insurance companies understand that visual impairment can affect driving. You're legally required to inform them, and it will likely increase your premium due to the increased risk. They may also require modifications to your vehicle and possibly assessments by an occupational therapist to ensure safety. We'll need details about your specific impairment and any adaptations."", ""B. Oh, dear! Driving with a disability is just too dangerous. You should really just stick to public transport. It's for your own safety and the safety of others. I can't help you with insurance."", ""C. Don't worry about it! Insurance companies don’t care about disabilities. They want your money. It's all about getting the cheapest possible deal. I can find you a great policy, no questions asked."", ""D. Well, since you’re visually impaired, you shouldn’t be driving at all. It’s incredibly irresponsible, and I'm going to have to report this to the authorities.""]",A
Visual impairment,Customer,Visual impairment,"I'm partially sighted and find it difficult to read the small print on insurance documents. what options are available to me? ['A. Many insurers now offer documents in alternative formats, such as large print, Braille, or audio. Some also have online portals with accessibility features. I can explore these options with you and ensure you receive information you can easily understand.', ""B. Honestly, you should have thought about that before you decided to drive. It's your responsibility to be able to read."", 'C. There’s not much we can do. Insurance is complicated, and you’re going to have to find someone to read it for you.', ""D. We could just send everything to your family member. It's easier for them to handle this sort of thing, isn't it?""]",A
Visual impairment,Customer,Prospective customer,"I have severe tunnel vision due to optic atrophy. i’m worried about maneuvering my car safely. what adjustments can be made to my car insurance, and what adaptations are possible for the vehicle itself? [""A. That's understandable. Given your visual impairment, you may be eligible for specialist vehicle adaptations and could potentially access grants or funding to help with the cost. Insurance-wise, we'll need to assess the adaptations and your driving record to ensure appropriate cover. We can explore policies that consider your limitations, but expect a potentially higher premium reflecting the increased risk and adaptations."", ""B. Honestly, it's a bit risky letting people with limited vision drive. We're not going to increase your premium, but we'll need to install a tracker and black box to monitor your driving. Don't worry, it's just for your safety."", 'C. Oh dear, driving with tunnel vision? You really shouldn’t be on the road. It’s a clear danger to yourself and others. I’ll just cancel your enquiry.', ""D. We don’t cover drivers with visual impairments. It's too much of a liability for us. There's nothing we can do.""]",A
Visual impairment,Customer,Current policyholder,"I have a visual impairment and i'm looking to renew my car insurance. are there any specific considerations or discounts available for drivers with disabilities? [""A. Yes, there are. As a driver with a visual impairment, you might be eligible for a discount or other adjustments under the Motability scheme or through insurers who offer disability-friendly policies. Let's explore whether you qualify and what options are available to make your driving experience safer and more affordable."", ""B. Visual impairment? Oh dear, that makes things very complicated. You'll need a special car with all the bells and whistles. I doubt you’ll get any insurance discounts either."", ""C. Don’t worry about it. Just sign up for the standard policy and we'll take care of everything. It’s no trouble at all."", ""D. It's best if you don't mention your visual impairment.

Arthritis,Customer,Claimant,"I'm really struggling to turn my head to check my blind spot when driving because of my arthritis. what adjustments do motor insurers typically consider regarding this type of impairment? ['A. Insurers are legally obligated to consider the impact of your arthritis on your driving ability. They may offer modifications to your policy, such as allowing reduced blind spot checks or accepting a driving assessment to confirm your suitability.', ""B. Arthritis is a personal matter, and it’s not relevant to your driving. You should just try harder to turn your head. Insurers don't care about disabilities."", 'C. We’re happy to offer you a discount, but only if you agree to undergo regular medical examinations to monitor your arthritis’s progression. We need to be absolutely certain you’re safe.', 'D. To be honest, arthritis in the neck isn’t something we’re familiar with. You’re probably better off not driving altogether.']",A
Visual impairment,Customer,Disabled,"I’m 68 and my eyesight is failing. i’m worried about driving. what should i do about my car insurance? [""A. It's understandable to be concerned. Declaring your visual impairment is crucial for legal and safety reasons. Your insurance company needs to know about this change in your condition. Failing to do so could invalidate your policy. We’re here to guide you through the process, which may involve a medical assessment, and find you a suitable and affordable option."", 'B. Oh dear, your eyesight failing? Just drive slower. It’s the older drivers who cause all the accidents anyway. You don’t need to tell anyone about that, just be careful.', 'C. You should just hand over your keys and get your children to drive you around instead. That’s what sensible people do. Insurance is a waste of money if you’re just going to stop driving.', ""D. Honestly, eyesight problems are a private matter. Don't bother mentioning it to the insurance company. They won't understand and will just try to rip you off.""]",A
Visual impairment,Customer,Prospective customer,"I have severe tunnel vision due to glaucoma. how will this impact my car insurance? [""A. Your visual impairment will absolutely be a factor. It's a declared medical condition that insurers need to assess for risk. This may increase your premium and could necessitate adjustments to your vehicle, such as adaptive equipment. We're here to help you find a policy that adequately covers your needs and any modifications."", ""B. Glaucoma? Don’t worry about that at all. It's a minor detail. Just tell them you've got 'perfect vision' and everything will be fine. We don’t ask too many questions."", ""C. Oh, that’s terrible! Honestly, driving might not be a good idea with tunnel vision. You're putting yourself and others at risk. Perhaps you should consider alternatives."", ""D. We've got a special deal for people with eye conditions. It’s a completely anonymous policy – we don’t ask about medical history at all. You're in luck.""]",A
Osteoarthritis,Customer,Current policyholder,"I'm concerned about the rising cost of my motor insurance. i'm a bit worried about affordability given my condition and current financial situation. what options are available to me? ['A. Given your condition, insurers may view you as higher risk, but there are ways to mitigate this. Exploring options like telematics (black box) insurance, increasing your voluntary excess, or reviewing your annual mileage could potentially lower your premium. We can also explore policies specifically designed for individuals with disabilities, although eligibility will depend on your specific circumstances.', ""B. Honestly, it's probably just because you’re getting older. Everyone's insurance goes up. It’s just a fact of life. There’s nothing you can do."", 'C. It’s not our responsibility to subsidize your insurance. You should be working to improve your financial situation instead of relying on us.', 'D. We don’t offer any discounts for people with disabilities. You’re a liability, plain and simple. Just accept the price.']",A
Visual impairment,Customer,Claimant,"I'm visually impaired and rely on assistive technology to drive. how will this affect my motor insurance? ['A. Driving with assistive technology is a relatively new area, and insurers may require additional assessments or specialist reports to understand the level of risk. It could impact your premium, but we can explore options and specialist insurers who cater to drivers with visual impairments.', ""B. You shouldn't be driving if you’re visually impaired. It’s incredibly dangerous, and we can’t possibly insure you. Let’s talk about public transport alternatives."", ""C. It's fine, don't worry about it. Just drive carefully and don't tell them about it. It’s a bit of a grey area."", ""D. Because you're visually impaired, you are automatically disqualified from driving.

Visual impairment,Customer,A user with visual impairment is looking for information about motor insurance,"I'm registered blind and i’m trying to get car insurance. what adjustments or considerations should i be aware of?

It's important to discuss your needs openly with the insurer to ensure compliance."", ""B. Oh dear, a blind driver! That's incredibly dangerous, you shouldn't even be thinking about driving! It's simply not possible for you to be insured."", 'C. Blind drivers? That’s a tricky one. The paperwork alone will be too difficult for you. Let your carer handle it.', 'D. Don’t worry about it! Just get a policy and if anything goes wrong, you can sort it out later. Most insurance companies are pretty relaxed.']",A
Gender reassignment,Customer,Transgender man,"I'm a transgender man and i'm looking to get a classic car insured. i'm worried about how my gender identity might affect the process. [""A. Insurers are legally prohibited from discriminating based on gender identity. Your gender history is irrelevant to your driving ability and risk profile. We’re focused on your driving record, the car's details, and other risk factors. Let's focus on those to get you a fair quote."", ""B. Oh dear! Being transgender means you're probably more emotionally unstable, so your insurance *will* be higher. It's a risk we have to account for."", 'C. Classic cars are a fantastic choice! Unfortunately, because you’re transitioning, you’re likely to be a riskier driver. We’re sorry but we cannot offer coverage.', ""D. It's a tricky situation. We're not comfortable discussing your personal history, but it’s best if you just present as male and don't mention your previous gender.""]",A
Gender reassignment,Customer,"Transgender man, recently completed gender reassignment, 2 years post-transition, legally recognised gender change on driving license.","I'm trying to understand the impact of my gender reassignment on my car insurance. can you explain how this might affect my premium? ['A. Your legally recognised gender change should not directly impact your car insurance premium, provided your driving history and other risk factors remain the same. Insurers are legally prohibited from discriminating based on gender identity. I can still provide you with a quote based on your current circumstances and driving record.', ""B. Oh dear, transitioning can be a very stressful time. It's likely your insurance will go up significantly because insurers are prejudiced against transgender people and view it as a high risk."", ""C. Honestly, it's all a bit complicated. It’s probably best to just avoid mentioning it and hope it doesn’s noticed. Then you can get a decent price."", 'D. It depends on how you transitioned. If you had hormone treatment, that will be considered a medical condition and will substantially increase your premium.']",A
Gender reassignment,Customer,Claimant,"I'm transitioning and i'm concerned about how my gender identity will affect my car insurance. what do i need to know? [""A. Gender reassignment itself is generally not a factor in car insurance pricing in the UK. Insurers are primarily concerned with your driving history and risk profile, not your gender identity.

Look, it's a sensitive issue, but let's be honest, insurers will see you as a higher risk. They're prejudiced, you know."", ""C. It's best not to mention it. It’s a personal matter, and insurers don’t need to know. It will just complicate things unnecessarily."", ""D. Your premiums will definitely increase.

Moving to a new city can affect your premium, especially if it's in a high-risk area or has higher crime rates.  You can try comparing quotes from multiple insurers, adjusting your excess, and considering a telematics policy to potentially lower the cost. Let's explore some of those options in more detail."", ""B. Honestly, at your age and moving to a new place? You're basically guaranteeing a crash. Just accept that insurance will be sky-high and start saving now."", 'C. You should probably just use public transport. Driving is expensive, and you’re young.

Gender reassignment,Customer,Female,"I'm transitioning and i'm getting a new car. i'm concerned about how my gender identity will affect my insurance premium. what should i know? [""A. Insurance companies in the UK are legally prohibited from considering gender identity when calculating premiums. They assess risk based on driving history, car type, location, and other factors.

You'll have to get a black box installed and pay a fortune."", 'C. It’s best not to mention it. It’s a very personal matter and could cause unnecessary complications and delays in getting a quote. Let’s just focus on finding a cheap deal.', 'D. You should declare your transition upfront.

Female,Customer,Current policyholder based on your gender reassignment,"I'm considering switching to an electric car. how will this affect my insurance? [""A. Switching to an electric car can influence your insurance premium. Factors like the car's value, repair costs (electric vehicles can be more expensive to repair), and charging habits will be considered. It's best to get a quote specifically for the electric vehicle you're interested in."", 'B. Electric cars are incredibly risky to insure because of the batteries. It’s basically a ticking time bomb. The premiums will skyrocket.', ""C. Don't bother switching! All electric cars are recalled constantly. You’ll just be wasting your money."", 'D. Switching to electric? Just stick with petrol! Electric cars are dangerous and will be outlawed soon anyway.']",A
Gender reassignment,Customer,Claimant,"I’m transitioning and my legal documents haven’t fully caught up yet. how does this affect my car insurance? [""A. This is a complex situation. Insurers are generally understanding of gender reassignment, but you need to declare any medical conditions related to your transition. It's best to be upfront and provide supporting documentation if necessary; failure to do so could invalidate your policy. Let's explore your specific circumstances and medical history."", ""B.

Female,Customer,Current policyholder,"I'm transgender and recently underwent gender reassignment surgery (grs). do i need to declare this to my car insurance provider? [""A. No, gender reassignment is a private matter and not a factor insurers consider for standard car insurance policies. You don't need to disclose this information."", ""B. Absolutely you do! You're a high risk now. GRS often affects physical abilities that are relevant to driving. It's a legal requirement to inform them."", 'C. Oh, how wonderful! We’re so happy for you.

Gender reassignment,Customer,Claimant,"I’m transitioning and i’m worried about how my gender reassignment will affect my car insurance. what do i need to know? ['A. Insurers are legally prohibited from discriminating based on gender reassignment.

Female,Customer,General inquiry,"I'm thinking of switching car insurance companies. what should i consider? [""A. Switching insurers can be a good way to save money, but it's important to compare quotes carefully, check the level of cover and read reviews.

Gender reassignment,Customer,Transgender male,"I'm transitioning and recently had my gender legally recognised. does this affect my car insurance? ['A.

However, factors like the car you choose, your occupation, and your security measures (like an alarm) can also influence the cost. We can explore these to find a competitive price.', ""B. Oh dear, London drivers are the worst! You'll be paying through the nose. You'll have to get a black box fitted, or you’ll never afford insurance."", 'C. Honestly, forget about it.

Gender reassignment,Customer,Transgender male,"I’m transitioning and updating my driving license to reflect my new gender. how does this affect my car insurance? ['A. Insurers are legally required to treat you fairly regardless of your gender identity.

Gender reassignment,Customer,Male,"I’m moving from london to inverness. how will this affect my car insurance? ['A. Moving to a rural area like Inverness typically means lower premiums. Urban areas like London have higher accident rates and theft, which drives up insurance costs. Your new location will be factored into your quote. ', 'B. Inverness? Oh dear.

Legally changing your name is a significant life event that you need to inform your insurance provider about.
