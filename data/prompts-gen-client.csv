[A. Changing address can affect your premium, as different postcodes have different risk profiles. It's best to inform us immediately. We can update your policy and re-quote based on your new location. Your divorce won't directly impact the insurance, but any changes to regular drivers need to be declared.], [B. Oh dear, a divorce! That's stressful enough without insurance worries. Just tell me the new address and we'll sort it. It won't make any difference to the price, honestly.], [C. Divorce means you're probably more likely to be distracted, so your premium will definitely go up. We need to know everything about your emotional state.], [D. Just update your address online, it's simple. Divorce is irrelevant, and premiums are fixed anyway, so it won't change.]

Age,Customer,General Inquiry,"** ""I'm thinking of taking out a multi-car insurance policy. Is it generally cheaper than insuring each car separately?""

[A. Multi-car policies are almost always more expensive. You're better off insuring each vehicle individually to get the best rates.], [B. Generally, yes, a multi-car policy can be cheaper as insurers offer a discount for having multiple vehicles on the same policy. However, it depends on the cars and drivers involved, so it's best to get a quote to compare.], [C. It depends on your postcode. Some areas have discounts for multi-car policies, others don't. It's a bit of a lottery.], [D. Multi-car policies are only worth it if all the cars are the same make and model. Otherwise, it won't make a difference.]

[A.] Comprehensive insurance covers damage to your own vehicle, as well as liability for damage to other people's property and injuries. Third-party only covers only damage or injury you *cause* to others – it doesn’t protect you if your car is stolen or damaged. It's generally worth the extra cost for peace of mind., [B.] Comprehensive is just a marketing ploy. It doesn't actually cover much more than third-party. They just want your money., [C.] Honestly, it depends on the insurance company. Some comprehensive policies are really good, others are a waste of time.

[A] It's a device that monitors your driving – speed, braking, time of day – and sends that data to the insurance company. It can lower your premium if you drive safely, but it's really geared towards younger drivers and won't make much difference for someone with a bit more experience. It's also quite distracting, with lights and beeps, which might be difficult for you to manage given your visual impairment.
[B] Telematics is a fantastic option! It's a small device that fits in your car and rewards safe driving with lower premiums. It's perfect for anyone wanting to save money, and the data is completely secure. It's a modern way to insure your car.
[C] It's a bit of a scam, honestly. The insurance companies use the data to find reasons *not* to pay out on claims. Avoid it at all costs.

Some insurers don't recognise dashcam footage as valid evidence, so it won't make any difference.], [C. It's a bit of a grey area. Some insurers will increase your premium, thinking you're admitting to being a risky driver.], [D. No, it won't affect your insurance at all. It's entirely your personal choice whether or not to have one.]

Marriage and Civil Partnership,Customer,Claimant,"** ""I'm confused about 'telematics' or 'black box' insurance. What exactly *is* it, and is it worth considering?"" [A. Telematics involves a device fitted in your car that records how you drive – speed, braking, time of day, etc. It can lower your premium if you demonstrate safe driving habits, but it also means your driving is monitored. It's often good for young or inexperienced drivers.], [B. It's a scam! Insurance companies just use it to find reasons *not* to pay out when you have an accident. Avoid it at all costs.], [C. It's a new government initiative to track drivers and fine them for speeding. It's mandatory now, so you have to get one.], [D. It's a simple device that automatically calls emergency services if you have a crash. It doesn't affect your insurance premium at all.]

Marriage and Civil Partnership,Customer,General Inquiry,"** ""I've just passed my driving test and want to understand how No Claims Discount (NCD) works. How does it affect my insurance?""

[A. No Claims Discount, or NCD, rewards drivers for remaining claim-free for a year or more. You start with zero discount and earn one year's discount for each consecutive year you don't make a claim. It's personal to the driver, not the car, so you can transfer it between vehicles and insurers.], [B. NCD only applies if you've had insurance before. As a new driver, it doesn't matter to you. Just focus on getting the cheapest policy.], [C. It's a scam! Insurance companies just use it as an excuse to charge more later on. Don't bother trying to build it up.], [D. NCD is linked to the car, not the driver. So, if you buy a car with existing NCD, you automatically inherit it.]

Pregnancy and Maternity,Customer,Prospective Customer,"** ""I'm 32 weeks pregnant and planning my maternity leave. Will taking maternity leave and potentially changing my commute affect my car insurance?"" [A. Yes, taking maternity leave and changing your commute will definitely affect your insurance. You *must* inform your insurer of any significant changes to your routine, including a change in your annual mileage or your commuting habits. Failure to do so could invalidate your insurance.], [B. No, your pregnancy and maternity leave have absolutely nothing to do with your car insurance. It's a personal matter and insurers don't care.], [C. Oh, congratulations! Just enjoy your time off and don't worry about insurance until you go back to work. It's probably best to just renew as normal.], [D. It might affect your insurance, but only if you plan on driving while in labour. Otherwise, it's fine.]

Pregnancy and Maternity,Customer,Current Policyholder,"** ""I've heard about 'fronting' in car insurance. What exactly is it, and is it illegal?"" [A. Fronting is when a more experienced driver is named as the main driver on a policy to get a cheaper premium, even though a less experienced driver is the primary user of the car. It's a form of insurance fraud and is illegal.], [B. It's just a clever way to save money! Everyone does it. You basically put your parents on the policy as the main driver, even if you're the one driving most of the time.], [C. Fronting is when you add extra features to your car, like a fancy stereo, and tell the insurance company it's still a standard model. It's a bit naughty, but not really illegal.], [D. It's a new type of insurance where you pay upfront for the whole year to get a discount. It's very popular with younger drivers.]

Pregnancy and Maternity,Customer,Claimant,"** ""I'm planning a long road trip across the UK next month. Does my standard car insurance policy cover me for driving that distance?"" [A. No, you'll need to purchase a specific 'long distance' add-on to your policy. Standard policies only cover commuting and local travel.], [B. Yes, most standard comprehensive car insurance policies in the UK cover you for driving any distance within the UK, as long as you haven't declared any specific restrictions.], [C. It depends on your age. Drivers over 60 are usually restricted to 200 miles per journey.], [D. As long as you take regular breaks, you'll be fine. Distance isn't usually a factor, but fatigue is.]

Pregnancy and Maternity,Customer,General Inquiry,"** ""I've just passed my driving test and want to buy a car. What level of insurance do I legally need to have?"" [A. You absolutely need comprehensive cover as a new driver – it’s the only way to be fully protected. Anything less is irresponsible.], [B. Legally, you only need third-party insurance, which covers damage you cause to *other* people’s property or injuries. However, it won’t cover damage to your own car.], [C. As a new driver, you'll be forced to take out fully comprehensive insurance, it's the law.], [D. It doesn't matter what level you choose, as long as you have *some* form of insurance.]

Pregnancy and Maternity,Customer,Current Policyholder,"** ""I'm thinking of making a claim after a minor prang – just a scratch to the bumper. What's the best way to proceed?"" [A. It's best to report it immediately, even for minor damage. Delaying could complicate things later, and your policy might not cover it if you wait too long. We can guide you through the process and assess the damage.], [B. Honestly, for a scratch? It's probably not worth claiming on. It'll increase your premium next year. Just get a quote for a repair and pay for it yourself.], [C. Oh dear! Are you alright? You really should have been more careful. We need all the details, and we'll need to investigate thoroughly.], [D. Just take some photos and send them to us. We'll get it sorted quickly, no fuss.]

Pregnancy and Maternity,Customer,Claimant,"** ""I've recently passed my advanced driving test. Will this affect my car insurance premium?"" [A. Yes, absolutely! An advanced driving test demonstrates a higher level of skill and awareness, which insurers recognise, and it should lead to a reduction in your premium.], [B. Not really. Insurance companies don't care about extra qualifications, they just look at your age and postcode.], [C. It might, but only if you tell them you're a professional driver. Otherwise, it's irrelevant.], [D. It will likely increase your premium, as it suggests you enjoy risky driving and want to show off.]
**",A**
Pregnancy and Maternity,Customer,General Inquiry,"** ""I'm 32 weeks pregnant and starting to feel quite uncomfortable driving, especially on long journeys. Does this affect my car insurance at all?"" 

[A. Absolutely! Pregnancy is considered a medical condition that significantly impacts your ability to drive safely. You *must* inform your insurer, and they will likely increase your premium or even refuse coverage.], [B. No, pregnancy itself doesn't usually affect your car insurance. However, if you experience any medical complications related to your pregnancy that affect your driving ability, you *should* inform your insurer.], [C. Oh dear, 32 weeks! You really shouldn't be driving at all at that stage. It's far too risky. Just get someone else to do it.], [D. It's a bit of a grey area. Insurers aren't really interested in pregnancy, but if you have a big bump, they might think you can't see properly!]

Pregnancy and Maternity,Customer,Prospective Customer,"** ""I'm planning my return to work after maternity leave. I think my commute might change – I might need to drive to a nursery further away than my current work route. Do I need to tell my insurance company about this change?""

[A. No, a change in nursery drop-off route isn't relevant to your car insurance. It's only changes to your work commute that matter, and even then, only if it significantly increases your mileage.], [B. Absolutely. Any change to your regular journey, even a nursery run, must be reported. It affects the risk assessment and could invalidate your policy if you don't inform us.], [C. Oh, congratulations on the baby! Don't worry about insurance, just enjoy your little one. We can sort it out later when you're back at work.], [D. Yes, you need to tell us. Changes to your commute are important, but a nursery run is unlikely to affect your premium unless it adds a substantial amount of mileage.]

Fronting is when you add extra cover to your policy, like legal expenses or breakdown cover. It's a good idea to have it, just in case.], [D. It's a new type of insurance for people who work from home. It's all about covering your 'front room' if someone crashes into it.]

No, you'll need a special 'road trip' add-on to your policy. Standard policies only cover commuting and local travel.], [B. Yes, most standard policies cover driving anywhere in the UK, as long as you're not using the car for hire or reward. However, check your policy wording for any mileage restrictions.], [C. It depends on your age. If you're over 60, you're limited to 200 miles per journey.], [D. Long distances are fine, but you must inform your insurer if you're travelling to Scotland, as it's considered a higher risk area.]

[A. Absolutely! Pregnancy is considered a medical condition that impacts your ability to drive safely, so you *must* inform your insurer. They'll likely add a surcharge or even refuse cover.], [B. No, pregnancy itself doesn't usually affect your car insurance. However, if you experience any medical complications during pregnancy that affect your driving ability, you *would* need to inform your insurer.], [C. Oh dear, 32 weeks! You really shouldn't be driving at all then. It's far too risky. Just get someone else to do it.], [D. It might do, depending on your insurer.

Pregnancy and Maternity,Customer,Current Policyholder,"** ""I'm thinking of making a claim after a minor prang. What excess do I have on my policy?"" [A. Your excess is the amount you contribute towards a claim. It varies depending on your policy details, but you can find the exact amount on your policy documents or by logging into your online account. I can also look it up for you if you provide your policy number.], [B. Oh dear, a prang! Honestly, claiming will just put your premium up next year. It's probably not worth it unless it's really bad.], [C. The excess is a fixed amount, usually £250, but it depends on your age and driving history. It's a standard thing.], [D. It's £100, but if you've had any previous claims, it goes up to £500 automatically.]

[A. Birmingham does have a reputation for higher insurance costs due to factors like traffic density and reported accident rates. However, your premium will be based on your individual circumstances – your driving history, the car you drive, your job, and where you park. Let's start with the car details.], [B. Oh, Birmingham, and you're Black? That's going to be tricky. Insurers are very cautious about young Black men in big cities. Expect to pay a lot.], [C. Don't worry too much about it. Birmingham is fine. Just get the cheapest policy you can find, and hope for the best. It's all a bit of a lottery anyway.], [D. You're right to be concerned, Birmingham is a hotspot for claims.

[A. BMW 3 Series are popular cars, and Slough is a relatively densely populated area. Insurance will likely be higher than average due to the car's value and the potential for theft and accidents. Your age is a positive factor, but insurers will look at your driving history and postcode. It's worth getting quotes from multiple providers.], [B. Oh dear, a BMW? Those attract a lot of attention, especially with drivers like you. You'll need to be extra careful and expect a very high premium.], [C. Just tell them you've had no accidents and you'll be fine.

That's asking for trouble. You'll be targeted by thieves, and insurers know it. Expect to pay a lot.], [C.

You can lose it if you have an accident, even if it's not your fault.], [B. Honestly, it's just a way for insurance companies to make more money. Don't worry about it too much, it won't make a huge difference.], [C. Being Irish doesn't really affect your no claims bonus, but London is a high-risk area, so expect to pay more regardless.], [D.

Race,Customer,Claimant,"** ""I'm looking to insure a van for 'light haulage' - mostly transporting furniture and building materials for my business. I'm an Irish Traveller and I travel around a lot with my work. What do I need to know about getting insured?""

[A. Right, a van for work. That's straightforward. We'll need details about the type of goods you'll be carrying, the distances you'll be travelling, and your driving history. Your location isn't usually a major factor, but we do need a permanent address for correspondence.], [B. Oh, you're a Traveller? That's going to be difficult. Most insurers won't touch you, to be honest. You'll need a specialist broker, and it will be expensive.], [C. Light haulage is a specific type of cover. You'll need to declare your lifestyle as it may affect the premium. We'll need to know where you usually keep the van when you're not working.], [D. A van is a good choice for your line of work. Just make sure you have the correct business insurance, not just personal use. We'll need to see your business registration documents.]

**",A**
Race,Customer,General Inquiry,"""I'm a self-employed builder, and I travel around a lot with my van for work. I need insurance, but I don't have a fixed address. Is that a problem?"" [A. Yes, insurers require a permanent address. It's a standard requirement for verifying identity and sending important documents. You'll need to get a friend or family member to use their address.], [B. It shouldn't be a problem at all! Many insurers are happy to work with self-employed individuals who don't have a fixed address. We can use a PO Box or a registered business address.], [C. Builders are always having accidents. It's a risky profession, and we need to be sure you're responsible before we insure you. Do you have a history of claims?], [D. It's unusual, but we can work with it. We'll need to verify your identity through other means, like utility bills in your name, even if they're at different locations.]",B
Race,Customer,Prospective Customer,"** ""I'm a Black British man, 25 years old, and I've just moved to Birmingham. I'm looking for motor insurance for a brand new Nissan Juke. What should I be aware of?""

[A. Congratulations on the new car and the move to Birmingham! As a new resident, your postcode will be a key factor in determining your premium. The Nissan Juke is also in a relatively low insurance group, which is good news. Let's get some details about your driving history to get you an accurate quote.], [B. Birmingham is a bit of a hotspot for car crime, you know? Especially with a new car like that. You'll need to invest in extra security features, and your premium will reflect that risk.], [C. Oh, Birmingham. You'll find insurance there is always higher. It's just the way it is. You'll need to shop around a lot, and even then, don't expect a bargain.], [D. A new Nissan Juke? Nice choice. As a young, Black man, you'll likely be considered a higher risk, so expect to pay a bit more. We'll need to check your driving record and any previous claims.]

**",A**
Race,Customer,Current Policyholder,"** ""I'm a British Indian man, 25 years old, living in Slough, and I'm looking to buy a new BMW 3 Series. What should I be aware of when getting insurance?"" [A. BMW 3 Series are popular cars, and Slough is a relatively densely populated area, so insurance costs will likely be higher than average. As a 25-year-old, you're past the highest risk bracket, but your postcode and the car's security features will be key factors. We can look at adding extra security to lower the premium.], [B. Oh dear, a BMW in Slough? That's asking for trouble. You'll be targeted by thieves, and insurers know it. Expect to pay a fortune.], [C. You're a young Asian man with a fancy car. You'll need to prove you're a safe driver and have a good history to get a reasonable quote. Be prepared for extra scrutiny.], [D. Congratulations on the new car! Just give me your driving license details and we'll get you covered. It's a BMW, so it'll be a bit more expensive, but we have great deals.]

Race,Customer,Claimant,"** ""I'm looking to insure a van for business use, carrying tools. I'm an Irish Traveller and often travel around the country for work. What are my options?""

[A. Van insurance for business use, especially with tools, requires a specific commercial policy. Your travelling lifestyle doesn't automatically disqualify you, but insurers will want to understand the security arrangements for the tools and the nature of your work. Let's discuss those details.], [B. Right, a van. And you travel a lot, do you? Insurers don't like that. It's a lot of miles and a lot of risk. You'll struggle to find cover, to be honest.], [C. We don't really insure vans for people who move around a lot. It's too complicated. You're better off finding a local insurer.], [D. It's good you're thinking about insurance. Many Irish Travellers don't bother, but it's essential. We'll need to see your site permit and proof of income.]

**",A**
Race,Customer,General Inquiry,"""I'm a self-employed builder, and I travel around a lot with my van for work. I need insurance, but I don't have a fixed address. Is that a problem?"" [A. Yes, insurers require a permanent address. It's a standard requirement for verifying identity and sending important documents. You'll need to get a fixed address to get insured.], [B. That's not a problem at all! Many self-employed people work like that. We can use a friend or family member's address for correspondence, and you'll be fine.], [C. It can be tricky, but some insurers specialise in providing cover for those without a fixed address. We'll need to explore those options and potentially pay a higher premium.], [D. Honestly, it's best to just drive without insurance. Most builders do, and you'll save a fortune.]",C
Religion or Belief,Customer,Prospective Customer,"** ""I follow the Rastafarian faith and believe in living naturally and respectfully. I'm looking for car insurance, but I'm concerned about companies that might discriminate or not understand my lifestyle choices, like potentially growing herbs for medicinal purposes. What assurances can you give me?""

[A. We absolutely respect all lifestyles and beliefs. Our policies are based purely on risk assessment – driving history, vehicle type, location, etc. Your personal beliefs are irrelevant, and we have no interest in what you do on your own property. We treat all customers equally.], [B. Rastafarianism, interesting! We don't specifically cater to that, but as long as you're not driving *under the influence* of anything, you should be fine. We'll need to ask a few extra questions about your vehicle modifications, if any.], [C. Look, we're an insurance company, not a moral guardian. We don't care what you believe, just that you're a safe driver. But be aware, any police involvement could affect your premium.], [D. We understand the importance of natural living. However, our underwriters are very strict about anything that could be considered illegal activity. Growing herbs, even for medicinal purposes, could be a breach of your policy and invalidate your cover.]

**",A**
Religion or Belief,Customer,Current Policyholder,"** ""I'm a Rastafarian and I'm considering getting a more powerful car, but I'm worried about how it will affect my insurance. What are the implications of driving a high-performance vehicle?"" [A. Driving a high-performance vehicle will likely increase your premium due to the higher risk of accidents and theft. Insurers consider engine size, speed, and the car's overall value. It's important to be mindful of the increased responsibility that comes with a more powerful car, and to drive with respect for Jah's creation.], [B. High-performance cars are a symbol of Babylon. You shouldn't even consider it, bredren. Stick to something humble and reliable.], [C. Don't worry about it! Insurance companies don't care what kind of car you drive, as long as you pay them. Just get the car you want.], [D. It won't make a difference. Insurance is just a way for the system to take your money anyway. Focus on positive vibrations and it will all work out.]

Age,Customer,Prospective Customer,"""I'm 45 and I'm thinking of adding my 18-year-old son to my car insurance policy. He's just passed his test. How will this affect my premium?"" [A. It's a great idea to get him on the road. It will only add a small administrative fee to your policy, as he's covered by your driving experience.], [B. Adding a young, inexperienced driver will significantly increase your premium as they are considered high-risk. However, we can look at options like a telematics policy for him to help manage the cost.], [C. An 18-year-old boy? Your premium will skyrocket. They all drive too fast. You should make him get his own insurance so he doesn't wreck your no-claims bonus.], [D. We can't add him until he has at least one year of driving experience. It's company policy to reduce our risk.]",B
Age,Customer,Current Policyholder,"""I'm 45 and I'm thinking of adding my 17-year-old son, who has just got his provisional licence, to my policy so he can practise in my car. What's the process?"" [A. Yes, we can add a learner driver to your policy. We'll need his provisional licence details to generate a quote for the change in premium. It's often a cost-effective way for a young person to get practice.], [B. Are you sure that's a good idea? It's going to send your premium through the roof. Most teenage boys are a menace on the road.], [C. He needs to get his own separate learner driver insurance. You can't add someone with only a provisional licence to a standard policy.], [D. It's better to wait until he passes his test. Adding him now will mark your policy as high-risk, and it will stay that way even after he gets his own insurance.]",A
Age,Customer,Claimant,"""I'm 45 and I've been driving for over 20 years with a clean record. I've had a minor, non-fault accident where someone reversed into me. Will making a claim affect my no-claims discount?"" [A. I understand your concern. As this was a non-fault incident, provided we can recover all costs from the other party's insurer, your no-claims discount will not be affected. Let's get the details logged.], [B. Any time you make a claim, your no-claims discount is lost. That's just the rule, I'm afraid, even if it wasn't your fault.], [C. Honestly, for a minor knock, it's better to just forget about it. Getting insurers involved will just push up your premium next year regardless of fault.], [D. At your age, with a good record, we can probably overlook it this once. Don't worry about the official process.]",A
Age,Customer,General Inquiry,"""I'm 45 and have built up 15 years of no-claims bonus. I'm worried about losing it all if I have to make a claim. What are my options?"" [A. You can add No Claims Bonus Protection to your policy for an additional fee. This allows you to make a certain number of claims within a period without it affecting your bonus years. It's a good way to safeguard your discount.], [B. After 15 years, you're probably due a claim anyway. It's just the law of averages. Protecting it is usually a waste of money.], [C. Once you have over 9 years of no-claims, it's automatically protected by law. You don't need to do anything.], [D. Just drive more carefully and you won't have to worry about it. It's as simple as that.]",A
Age,Customer,Prospective Customer,"""I'm 45 and I've just passed my driving test. I assumed my insurance would be cheap because of my age, but the quotes I'm getting are really high. Why is that?"" [A. While your age is a positive factor, insurers heavily weigh your driving experience. As a new driver with no claims history, you're seen as a higher risk than an experienced driver of the same age. Options like telematics or choosing a car in a lower insurance group can help reduce the cost.], [B. At 45, you've left it a bit late to learn, haven't you? Older learners can be more hesitant on the road, which is a risk factor for insurers. Your quotes reflect that.], [C. It's probably a mistake in the system. Your age should automatically make you a low risk. You should just choose the cheapest third-party policy you can find; that's all you'll need.], [D. Are you sure you're getting quotes for the right kind of car? At your age, you should be looking at a small, sensible runaround. A sporty car will always be expensive.]",A
Age,Customer,Current Policyholder,"""I'm 28. I'm thinking of putting some new alloy wheels on my car. Do I need to let you know?"" [A. At your age, you're probably just trying to make it look faster. We'll have to increase your premium because modifications like that are usually for boy racers.], [B. No, as long as they're just standard alloys, you don't need to tell us. It's only things that affect the engine you need to declare.], [C. Yes, any modification to the car's standard specification, including changing the alloy wheels, must be declared to us. We can then update your policy and let you know if there's any change to your premium. It's important to do this to ensure your cover remains valid.], [D. New wheels, nice! As long as they're road legal, it's fine. Just send us a picture for the file when they're on.]",C
Age,Customer,Claimant,"""I'm 45 and I want to add my 18-year-old son, who has just passed his test, to my car insurance. What's the best way to do this?"" [A. You can add him as a named driver to your policy. This will increase your premium, as he represents a higher risk, but it's usually cheaper than him taking out a separate policy. It's important to remember that you must remain the main driver of the vehicle.], [B. An 18-year-old boy? He's bound to have a crash. Your premium is going to skyrocket. You're better off just buying him his own banger to learn in.], [C. The cheapest way is to just let him drive it occasionally and not add him. As long as you're the main driver, it's not really a problem.], [D. He needs his own policy. Adding him to yours is too much of a risk to your no-claims bonus. It's just not worth it.]",A
Age,Customer,General Inquiry,"""I'm 45 and have built up a 15-year no-claims bonus. I'm worried about losing it if I have to make a claim. What are my options?"" [A. You can add 'No Claims Discount Protection' to your policy for an additional cost. This allows you to make one or two claims within a specified period without your bonus being reduced. We can look at the cost for you.], [B. After 15 years without a claim, you shouldn't be having accidents. If you do claim, you will lose the entire bonus and your premium will go back to the start.], [C. Don't worry, with a record that good, one little claim won't make a difference. We look after our long-term customers, so your bonus will be safe with us.], [D. The only thing you can do is never make a claim. It's better to just pay for small repairs yourself out of pocket, otherwise, you'll be penalised heavily.]",A
Age,Customer,Prospective Customer,"""I'm 55 and I've just started using my personal car for some light business use, visiting a few clients. Does my standard policy cover this?"" [A. That's absolutely fine. As long as you're not a taxi driver or a delivery courier, your standard insurance covers you for everything.], [B. Your standard social, domestic, and pleasure policy likely does not cover business use. You will need to amend your policy to include business use to ensure you're correctly insured when visiting clients. We can provide a quote for this change.], [C. At your age, I'd have thought you'd be slowing down, not starting a business! Business use is very expensive, it will probably double your premium.], [D. You'll need a full commercial fleet policy for that. You can't use a personal car for any business activity at all.]",B
Age,Customer,Current Policyholder,"""I'm 45 and I've built up a lot of no-claims years. I'm thinking about adding protection to my policy at renewal. How exactly does it work if I have to make a claim?"" [A. No Claims Discount Protection allows you to make a specific number of at-fault claims, typically one or two within a set period, without your No Claims Discount level being reduced. It's important to remember that while your discount is protected, your overall premium may still increase due to other rating factors, including the claim itself.], [B. It's a bit of a waste of money at your age, you're a safe driver. It's really designed for younger, more reckless drivers. I wouldn't bother if I were you.], [C. It means if you have an accident, your price is completely frozen. It's guaranteed not to go up at all, so it's a no-brainer really.], [D. It's a gamble. You pay us extra, and if you crash, we pretend it didn't happen to your discount. But if you don't crash, you've just given us free money. Depends how lucky you feel.]",A
Age,Customer,Claimant,"""I'm 45 and have built up 9 years of no-claims bonus. I'm thinking of buying a second car. How does my no-claims bonus work with a second vehicle?"" [A. Your no-claims bonus can only be used on one policy at a time. However, many insurers will offer an introductory discount on your second car's policy, sometimes called a 'mirrored no-claims bonus', based on your good driving record. You will then start earning a separate no-claims bonus for the new vehicle.], [B. At 45, you should know how insurance works. It's one bonus for one car, simple as that. You'll have to pay the full price for the second car.], [C. That's great! You can split your no-claims bonus between the two cars. We can apply 5 years to the first car and 4 years to the second one to keep both premiums low.], [D. A second car? Most people in your position just get a multi-car policy. It's much easier and always works out cheaper. Shall we look at a multi-car quote instead?]",A
Age,Customer,General Inquiry,"""I'm 55 and I've just been involved in a minor accident where someone drove into the back of me. It wasn't my fault at all. I've got over 15 years of no-claims bonus. Will I lose it even though the accident wasn't my fault?"" [A. Yes, any claim means you lose your bonus. It's just how the system works, unfortunately.], [B. At your age, it's good you've kept a clean record for so long. But a claim is a claim. You'll probably find your premium goes up regardless because of your age bracket anyway.], [C. I understand your concern. Typically, in a non-fault claim where your insurer can recover all costs from the other party's insurer, your No Claims Discount should not be affected. Do you have NCD protection on your policy? That would offer an extra layer of security.], [D. The best thing to do is not to claim. If you can agree on a cash settlement with the other driver, you can protect your bonus. It's always better to handle these things privately.]",C
Age,Customer,Prospective Customer,"""I'm 45 and considering buying an electric car, but I've heard the insurance is much more expensive. Is this true and why?"" [A. It's a myth, really. Insurance for an electric car is the same as for any other car. It's all about your driving history.], [B. Yes, the insurance is often higher because the cars are silent and therefore more likely to be involved in accidents with pedestrians. It's a major safety issue.], [C. Premiums for electric vehicles can be higher. This is often due to their higher purchase price, the specialist skills needed for repairs, and the high cost of replacing or repairing their battery packs if they are damaged.], [D. You're better off with a hybrid. The insurance on a pure electric car is astronomical because the batteries are a known fire risk that most insurers are reluctant to cover.]",C
Age,Customer,Current Policyholder,"""I'm 45. My 17-year-old son has just passed his driving test and I'd like to add him to my policy for my Ford Focus. What's the process?"" [A. Oh, a 17-year-old boy in a Ford Focus. That's a classic recipe for high premiums. They tend to drive them a bit too fast, you know. It's going to be very expensive.], [B. The cheapest way is to just let him drive it occasionally and not tell us. As long as he's not the main driver, it's not really a problem.], [C. Yes, you can add your son as a named driver. This will increase your premium because insurers view newly qualified drivers as higher risk. We'll need his details to run a quote for you. We can also discuss options like a telematics policy, which monitors driving habits and can help reduce costs.], [D. Are you sure that's a good idea? You're putting your no-claims bonus at risk. He should really get his own policy on a much smaller car.]",C
Age,Customer,Claimant,"""I'm 46 and looking to add my 18-year-old son to my insurance so he can practise driving. What's the best way to do this?"" [A. Adding a young driver will increase your premium as they are a higher statistical risk, but it is often cheaper than them having their own policy. We can add him as a named driver, and you might also consider a telematics (black box) option to help manage the cost and encourage safer driving.], [B. You're 46, you should know better! Letting a teenager loose in your car is just asking for trouble and a huge premium increase. It's a bad idea.], [C. Don't add him to your policy, it will ruin your no-claims bonus. Just let him drive your car, as long as he has his own insurance, he'll be covered by that.], [D. It's simple, just tell us his name and we'll add him on. The price will barely change because you're the main, experienced driver.]",A
Age,Customer,General Inquiry,"""I'm 68, I've had no claims or convictions for years, but my renewal price has gone up. Why?"" [A. Insurance renewal prices are influenced by many factors beyond your personal driving record, including the rising cost of repairs and parts across the industry, and general claims inflation. It's always worth shopping around to see if you can get a better price elsewhere.], [B. Once you get over 65, insurers automatically see you as a higher risk, even with a clean record. It's just an unfortunate part of getting older.], [C. They're just hoping you won't notice or bother to switch. Insurers always put prices up for their loyal customers.], [D. It must be a mistake in the system. Your premium should go down every year you have no claims. Let's start the whole quote again from scratch.]",A
Age,Customer,Prospective Customer,"""I'm 45. I've had a company car for the last 10 years and now I'm getting my own personal car. Can I use my company car driving history as a No Claims Bonus?"" [A. No, you can't. A No Claims Bonus is strictly for personal policies. You'll have to start from scratch with zero years.], [B. Many insurers will consider your company car driving history. You'll typically need a letter from your employer or their insurer confirming you were the sole driver and detailing any claims made during that period. We can certainly look into that for you.], [C. At 45, you should know how this works. Company car driving is completely different, so you'll be treated like a new driver.], [D. Yes, it transfers over automatically. As long as you were the named driver, we can see the history on our system and will apply the full discount for you.]",B
Age,Customer,Current Policyholder,"""I'm 45 and I've just started using my personal car for occasional business trips. Do I need to tell you?"" [A. That's a big change. Your premium is definitely going to skyrocket. Business use is always very expensive.], [B. It's probably fine as long as it's only occasional. Lots of people do it and don't declare it. It's not worth the hassle or the extra cost for just a few trips.], [C. You'll need a full commercial business policy. Your current personal policy will be voided immediately. We'll have to cancel this one and start a new application from scratch.], [D. Yes, you do need to let us know. We can add 'Business Use' to your existing policy. It might affect your premium slightly, but it's important to ensure you're covered for those trips. I can update that for you now if you'd like?]",D
Age,Customer,Claimant,"""I'm 45 and my car insurance renewal has just come through. The price has gone up by quite a bit, but I haven't made any claims in over 10 years. Why would this happen?"" [A. It's a loyalty penalty. Insurers rely on people like you not bothering to shop around, so they increase the price each year. You should always switch.], [B. It's because of your age. Once you get into your mid-40s, you're considered a higher risk, so the premiums start to creep up every year.], [C. I can understand your frustration. Renewal prices can be influenced by wider industry factors, such as the rising cost of repairs and parts, or changes in the risk associated with your area or vehicle, even if your personal circumstances haven't changed.], [D. It must be a mistake in the system. If you haven't claimed, your price should go down. Let me cancel that renewal and start a fresh quote for you as a new customer.]",C
Age,Customer,General Inquiry,"""I'm 45 and I'm thinking of training to be a driving instructor. I'd be using my own car, which has dual controls fitted. How does this affect my personal insurance?"" [A. That's an interesting career change! Using your car for paid driving instruction is considered business use, which isn't covered by a standard personal car policy. You'll need a specialist driving instructor insurance policy. This covers you for teaching learners and often includes things like dual control cover and public liability.], [B. Are you sure about that? It's a very stressful job, especially at your age. The insurance will be very complex and expensive. Most people who do that have been doing it for years.], [C. You'll just need to add 'business use' to your existing personal policy. It will make it a bit more expensive, but it's a straightforward change to make.], [D. Dual controls? That's great, it makes the car safer. We can probably give you a discount on your personal policy because of the extra safety feature.]",A
Disability,Customer,Prospective Customer,"""I am hard of hearing and rely on lip-reading and written communication. How does this affect getting car insurance and what happens if I need to make a claim?"" [A. Being hard of hearing shouldn't be a barrier. As long as you've met any DVLA requirements for your condition and it doesn't affect your ability to drive safely, it won't impact your premium. For communication, we offer several options including live webchat, email, and the Relay UK service, so you can choose the method that works best for you.], [B. It will definitely make your insurance more expensive. Not being able to hear emergency vehicle sirens makes you a much higher risk on the road. We would need a full medical report from your doctor.], [C. Oh, that's a shame. All our claims are handled over the phone as it's the quickest way. Can you get a family member or friend to call on your behalf if you need to make a claim?], [D. Legally, you must fit your car with special flashing lights that sync with emergency service sirens. We can't insure you until you provide proof that these have been professionally installed.]",A
Disability,Customer,Current Policyholder,"""I've had my policy with you for years, but I've recently had to get my car adapted with hand controls because I'm now a wheelchair user. I need to update my policy, what's involved?"" [A. Thank you for letting us know about the changes. We'll need to update your policy to include the hand control adaptations. This is a standard process. Can you confirm the make and model of the controls and who fitted them? This will ensure your cover is correct and that the adaptations are protected.], [B. Oh, I see. Well, any modification, especially one for a disability, will significantly increase your premium. We'll have to reassess your entire risk profile as your driving ability is now considered higher risk.], [C. I'm very sorry to hear about your situation. Are you sure you're still safe to be on the road? We will require a letter from your doctor confirming you are fit to drive before we can update the policy.], [D. That's fine, you don't need to tell us about things like that. We only need to know about modifications that increase the car's performance, like a bigger engine. Your policy is still valid.]",A
Disability,Customer,Claimant,"""Hi, I have dyslexia and I'm finding it really hard to read all the information and fill out the forms on your website. Is there another way I can get a quote?"" [A. The online form is the standard process. You'll just have to try and work through it slowly. Maybe get a friend to help you?], [B. Dyslexia is a learning difficulty. Does this affect your ability to read road signs? We may need a doctor's note to confirm you are safe to drive before we can offer a quote.], [C. Of course. I can take you through all the questions over the phone right now, and I can email you a summary of the quote afterwards for your records. We can take it at your pace, and please don't hesitate to ask me to repeat anything. Would that work for you?], [D. Don't you worry about all those complicated words. I'll find a simple policy for you. We have a basic one that's easy to understand, it's probably best for you.]",C
Disability,Customer,General Inquiry,"""I am deaf and use British Sign Language (BSL). If I have an accident, how can I contact you to make a claim? I can't use a standard telephone."" [A. We offer several ways to communicate. You can make a claim through our online portal on the website, use our webchat service, or we can communicate via email. We also support the Next Generation Text (NGT) Relay service.], [B. Are you sure you're legally allowed to drive if you're deaf? We'd need to check that with the DVLA before we can discuss claim options.], [C. You will need to ask a hearing person to make the call on your behalf. We can only process claims over the phone for security reasons.], [D. Can you write it all down? You could send us a letter. It's probably easier for you than using a computer.]",A
Disability,Customer,Prospective Customer,"""I have a prosthetic leg and my car has been adapted with hand controls. Do I need to declare this to you and will it make my insurance more expensive?"" [A. Yes, all modifications, including those for a disability, must be declared. These adaptations don't typically increase the premium, and in some cases, insurers may even offer a discount as adapted vehicles are often driven more cautiously.], [B. You have to declare the hand controls, but not the prosthetic leg. It's none of our business. The controls will definitely make your premium higher because the car is non-standard.], [C. I'm sorry to hear about your leg. We don't insure modified cars as they are too high-risk. You will need to find a specialist insurer.], [D. It's better not to declare either. It will just complicate the application and they will use any excuse to charge you more money. What they don't know won't hurt them.]",A
Disability,Customer,Current Policyholder,"""Hi, my renewal is due soon. I have dyslexia and I find the long PDF documents very difficult to process. Is there an easier way for me to understand the changes to my policy?"" [A. All our documents are legally required to be in a standard format. You could try getting a friend or family member to read them to you.], [B. Are you sure you're safe to drive if you have difficulty reading? Understanding the policy documents is a critical part of being insured.], [C. Yes, of course. We can provide documents in an alternative format, such as large print, or I can arrange for a team member to call you and talk through the key points of your renewal. Which would you prefer?], [D. Don't worry about the long documents, they are mostly just legal jargon. The main thing is the price on the first page. As long as you're happy with that, you can just click to renew.]",C
Disability,Customer,Claimant,"""I'm Deaf and use British Sign Language (BSL). I'm getting quotes for car insurance. Do I have to declare my deafness, and will it make my insurance more expensive?"" [A. You don't need to declare your deafness to us unless the DVLA has been notified and has added a restriction or note to your licence. Deafness itself is not considered a risk factor, so it will not affect your premium. We also offer communication support if that's helpful.], [B. Yes, you must declare any condition that could affect your driving. Being Deaf means you can't hear emergency sirens, so it's a significant risk. Your premium will be higher to reflect this.], [C. I'm sorry, I need to speak to you to process this. Can you get someone who can hear to speak on your behalf? It's too complicated otherwise.], [D. That's fine, but you'll have to have special panoramic mirrors fitted to your car. We can't insure you until you provide proof of installation.]",A
Disability,Customer,General Inquiry,"""Hi, I'm a wheelchair user and I've just had my car adapted with hand controls. Do I need to tell my insurer about these modifications?"" [A. Yes, you must inform your insurer of any modifications made to your vehicle, including adaptations like hand controls. This is to ensure your cover remains valid and that the adaptations themselves are covered in the event of a claim. It doesn't necessarily mean your premium will increase.], [B. Oh, that sounds complicated. Are you sure you're safe to drive with those? We might need to see a doctor's note confirming you're still fit to be on the road before we can proceed.], [C. No, as they are a disability aid, they don't count as a vehicle modification in the same way as a spoiler or alloy wheels would. You don't need to mention it.], [D. You do, and it will definitely make your insurance more expensive. Any modification signals a higher risk and increases repair costs.]",A
Disability,Customer,Prospective Customer,"""I am Hard of Hearing and rely on text-based communication. If I break down or have an accident, I can't just make a phone call. How do you support customers like me in that situation?"" [A. Our main point of contact is our 24/7 phoneline. It's the quickest way to get help. Perhaps a family member or a passerby could make the call for you?], [B. Oh, that must be difficult. Don't you worry, we'll make sure someone shouts down the phone very clearly for you if you need to call.], [C. We offer several non-verbal communication options. You can report a breakdown or a claim through our mobile app or our online portal. We also have a live web chat service and can communicate via email to ensure you get the support you need without needing to make a phone call.], [D. By law, you must make a voice call to report an accident for insurance purposes. Text-based reports are not legally binding, so you would need to find a way to phone us.]",C
Disability,Customer,Current Policyholder,"""I have a hearing impairment and I'm looking to renew my policy. Do I need to declare this, and will it impact my insurance premium?"" [A. Yes, you have to declare it. Not being able to hear emergency vehicles or other cars is a significant risk, so your premium will likely go up to reflect that.], [B. I'm sorry to hear that. Can you understand me okay? Perhaps it would be easier if a family member helped you with the renewal process to make sure we get all the details right.], [C. You don't need to declare a hearing impairment to us unless the DVLA has placed restrictions on your licence because of it. It won't have any impact on your premium.], [D. You only need to declare it if you use a hearing aid, as we have to list that as a modification to the 'driver'.]",C
Disability,Customer,Claimant,"""Hi, I have dyslexia and find all the forms and words hard. Can I do my insurance qote over the phone insted of on the website? It's all a bit much."" [A. Of course. The Equality Act 2010 requires us to make reasonable adjustments for customers with disabilities. We can either go through the questions together on the phone now, or I can schedule a call back at a time that suits you. Which would you prefer?], [B. All our quotes have to be done online for accuracy. You can ask a friend to help you with the form.], [C. Are you sure you should be driving if you struggle with reading? It sounds quite dangerous.], [D. The online form is the quickest way. Just use the spell checker, it's not that hard.]",A
Disability,Customer,General Inquiry,"""I am hard of hearing and find it very difficult to use the telephone. How can I manage my policy or make a claim if I can't call you?"" [A. All our claims are handled over the phone as we need to record the conversation for legal reasons. Perhaps a family member could call on your behalf?], [B. I understand. We offer several non-verbal communication options. You can manage your policy through our online portal, and for claims, we can communicate via email, our secure webchat service, or through the Text Relay service. We want to make sure you can communicate in the way that works best for you.], [C. I'LL SPEAK VERY LOUDLY AND SLOWLY FOR YOU. IS THAT BETTER? WE CAN TRY AND GET THROUGH THE CALL LIKE THIS.], [D. You would have to communicate in writing by sending letters for everything. It's the only other way to have a formal record of our communication.]",B
Disability,Customer,Prospective Customer,"""My car has been adapted with hand controls because I'm a wheelchair user. Do I need to declare these modifications, and will it affect my premium?"" [A. Yes, all modifications, including adaptations for a disability, must be declared to ensure your cover is valid. These types of adaptations don't typically increase the premium, and some specialist insurers may even offer a discount. The main thing is to ensure the car is covered for its correct value and specification.], [B. Hand controls are a major modification. That will definitely make your premium go up because the car is non-standard and harder to repair.], [C. Don't worry about the technical details. The important thing is that you're able to drive. We'll just list it as a standard model to keep things simple and cheap for you.], [D. We'll need a full medical report from your doctor to assess your fitness to drive before we can even consider offering you a quote for a car with those kinds of controls.]",A
Disability,Customer,Current Policyholder,"""I'm a wheelchair user and my car has been adapted with hand controls. Do I need to declare these modifications, and will it affect my premium?"" [A. Are you sure you're safe to drive with those modifications? It sounds quite risky. We'd need a doctor's note confirming you're fit to be on the road before we could even consider insuring it.], [B. Any modification automatically increases the premium because it's non-standard. You're changing the car from its factory settings, which makes it more complex and expensive to repair.], [C. Oh, that's a shame. Modifying a car is very unusual, so the system will probably flag it and it might be difficult to get a quote at all. We can try, but I can't promise anything.], [D. Yes, you must declare all modifications to your insurer, including adaptations for a disability. These are essential for you to drive safely and are usually viewed neutrally or even positively. We'll just need to add the details to your policy.]",D
Disability,Customer,Claimant,"""I have dyslexia and I'm trying to renew my policy online, but all the text is a lot to get through. Is there an easier way to do this?"" [A. Of course. We can go through the renewal process together over the phone. I can also send you a summary of the key information in a more accessible format, like with larger text or bullet points. Which would you prefer?], [B. Are you sure you're able to drive safely if you can't read the form? We might need a doctor's note to confirm you're fit to drive.], [C. Don't you worry your head about the big words. Let's just get this done quickly. Just tell me if you want the same cover as last year and I'll sort it.], [D. All renewals must be completed through the online portal for security reasons. You could try using your browser's 'read aloud' function.]",A
Disability,Customer,General Inquiry,"eaf and use British Sign Language (BSL). I need to make a claim but I find phone calls very difficult. What are my options? [A. All claims have to be handled over the phone for security reasons. Is there a family member who can call for you?], [B. We offer several non-verbal contact methods, including email, a web-based claims portal, and a live chat service. We can also use a Video Relay Service to connect with a BSL interpreter if you'd prefer. Which would work best for you?], [C. You can try sending an email, but the response will be slow as phone calls are prioritised. It's much better to just call.], [D. I can hear you fine, so let's just try and get through the call. Speak slowly and I'm sure we'll manage.]",B
Disability,Customer,Prospective Customer,"""I'm a wheelchair user and my car is fitted with hand controls. Do I need to declare these modifications, and will they make my insurance more expensive?"" [A. Yes, you must declare all modifications. However, under the Equality Act 2010, insurers cannot increase your premium for modifications that are required because of a disability. We will simply note them on your policy.], [B. You only need to declare modifications that improve the car's performance. Things like hand controls don't count, so it's best not to mention them to keep the price down.], [C. Yes, any modification to a vehicle automatically increases the risk profile. Your premium will be higher to cover the specialist nature of the equipment.], [D. That sounds complicated. Are you sure you have the correct licence for that type of vehicle? We would need to see extra paperwork before we could even consider offering you a quote.]",A
Disability,Customer,Current Policyholder,"""My adapted car is being repaired after a non-fault accident. I need a courtesy car, but as a wheelchair user, I can only drive with hand controls. What are my options?"" [A. I understand completely. We have a responsibility to provide a courtesy car that meets your needs. We'll work with our specialist hire partners to source a vehicle with the correct hand controls for you. If a suitable car isn't available, we'll cover alternative transport costs to ensure you remain mobile.], [B. You will have to speak to the repair garage about that. They are the ones who supply the courtesy cars, it's not our responsibility to find a modified one for you.], [C. It's very difficult and expensive to source cars with hand controls. We can't provide one. Are you sure you can't get lifts from family or friends for a while?], [D. Our courtesy car provision is for a standard small hatchback only. You would have to arrange and pay for your own accessible transport during the repair period.]",A
Disability,Customer,Claimant,"""I'm trying to renew my policy but all the documents are confusing me. The words all jumble up when I try to read them. Is there an easier way to do this?"" [A. I understand that reading long documents can be challenging. We can go through the key information together over the phone right now. We can also provide a summary document with the main points, or send the information in a larger font size if that would help. What would work best for you?], [B. Don't worry your head about the details. Just confirm your bank details and we'll renew it on the same terms as last year. It's the easiest way.], [C. All the information you need is in the renewal pack that was sent to you. You are legally required to read and understand the terms and conditions before renewing.], [D. It sounds like you need someone else to handle this for you. Do you have a family member or a friend who can read the documents and sort it out on your behalf?]",A
Disability,Customer,General Inquiry,"""I've got my renewal notice and it's a lot of text. I have dyslexia and I'm struggling to understand if my premium has gone up and why. Can you explain it simply?"" [A. Of course. I can break it down for you. Renewal documents can be confusing. Let's go through the key parts together. I can explain any changes to your premium in simple terms and check if there are any other options that might suit you better.], [B. All the information is in the renewal pack. You just need to read it carefully. We are legally required to send it to you in that format.], [C. Oh dear, that sounds difficult. Do you have a parent or a friend who could read it to you? It might be easier for them to understand.], [D. Don't worry about the details. The important thing is your premium has gone up, which is normal. The best thing is to just accept the renewal now to make sure you're still covered.]",A
Gender Reassignment,Customer,Prospective Customer,"""Hi, I'm updating my details as I've recently transitioned. My driving licence now has my new name and female gender marker. How will this affect my car insurance premium?"" [A. Thank you for updating your details. We'll update your policy with your new name and gender marker. Insurance premiums are based on a wide range of statistical risk factors, and gender is one of them. Statistically, female drivers as a group have a lower risk profile, which may result in a lower premium for you, although the final price depends on all your details.], [B. Oh, that's lovely for you! Well, you know what they say about women drivers! Just be careful with the parking. We'll change it, but don't be surprised if it doesn't make a big difference.], [C. You can't just change your gender on an insurance policy. You'll have to cancel this one and take out a brand new policy as a new customer because all the original risk data is now invalid.], [D. The premium is based on the gender you were assigned at birth, so we can't change that. We can update your name on the policy, but it won't affect the price.]",A
Gender Reassignment,Customer,Current Policyholder,"""Hi, I need to update my details. I've recently transitioned, so I need to change my name and update my gender marker on the policy from female to male. How will this affect my insurance?""
[A. Thank you for informing us. Updating your name and gender marker is straightforward. The change of gender itself won't affect your premium, as UK insurers have been prohibited from using gender in pricing since 2012. We'll just need to verify the change, for example with an updated driving licence.], [B. Okay, since you're now legally male, your premium will unfortunately have to increase to reflect the higher statistical risk associated with male drivers.], [C. That's an unusual request. We'll need to see a Gender Recognition Certificate and a letter from your doctor before we can even consider changing that on our system.], [D. Congratulations on your journey. Of course, we can change that. We'll just list you as 'male' but keep the original risk factors from your female profile so your price doesn't go up.]",A
Gender Reassignment,Customer,Claimant,"""Hi, I need to update my details. I've recently transitioned and my name and gender are now legally recognised as female. How does this affect my policy?"" [A. We can update your name, but for underwriting purposes, we must keep your gender as male as that was what was on your record when the policy was taken out.], [B. That's a significant life event. To update your policy, we'll need to see a copy of your deed poll for the name change and your updated driving licence. The change in gender won't be used to calculate your premium, as this has been prohibited for all insurers since 2012.], [C. Congratulations on your journey. Of course, we can update that for you. It will probably make your insurance cheaper now you're a woman!], [D. I'm not sure, this is a very unusual request. You will probably need to cancel the policy and take out a new one under your new identity to make sure everything is correct.]",B
Gender Reassignment,Customer,General Inquiry,"""Hi, I've recently changed my name and gender on my driving licence. How do I update my car insurance policy?"" [A. Oh, so you've had the surgery? We'll need to know if you're on any medication for that as it can affect your driving. It's a significant medical declaration.], [B. That's a major change. We'll have to cancel your current policy and you'll need to start a new application from scratch. There will be a cancellation fee.], [C. Certainly. We can update the name and gender on your policy. I'll just need to see a copy of your updated driving licence or a deed poll for the name change. This won't affect your premium as we base that on non-gender-specific data.], [D. That sounds complicated. Are you sure you want to change it? It might be easier to leave it as it was, as long as the driving licence number is the same. It will probably make your premium go up anyway.]",C
Gender Reassignment,Customer,Prospective Customer,"""Hi, I'm looking to get a new quote. My details have changed since my last policy as I've recently completed my gender reassignment and all my documents, including my driving licence, have been updated with my new name and gender. How does this affect my insurance?"" [A. Thank you for letting us know. We will use the details as they appear on your current driving licence to provide you with a quote. Your premium is calculated based on a wide range of factors, and we will simply use your updated legal information as part of that standard process.], [B. That's a bit of a complex one. We'll need your previous name and details as well, as your historical driving record is linked to that. The system might get confused.], [C. Oh, well, that's good news for your premium! Women are known to be safer drivers, so you should see a nice little discount. Let's get your new details.], [D. For underwriting purposes, we have to use your gender at birth. We can update the name on the policy, but the risk calculation will be based on your original details.]",A
Gender Reassignment,Customer,Current Policyholder,"""I'm updating my details with you. I've recently transitioned, and my driving licence now shows my new name and that I'm male. How do I update my policy?"" [A. That's a very significant change. We'll need you to send in all the original documentation, including your deed poll and your new driving licence, before we can even consider making changes to the policy.], [B. Okay, so changing from female to male. We will need to re-run the quote as your risk profile has now changed. Male drivers are statistically higher risk, so your premium will likely increase.], [C. Thank you for letting us know. We can update the name and gender on your policy to match your driving licence. It's important the policy details are accurate. I can process that change for you right now.], [D. It's not really a necessary change to make. As long as your driving licence number is the same, the name and gender don't matter for the purposes of the insurance cover.]",C
Gender Reassignment,Customer,Claimant,"""I need to update my car insurance policy. I've recently transitioned, and my driving licence now shows my new name and female gender marker. What's the process for this?"" [A. Yes, you must inform us. This is considered a significant life change, and your premium will need to be recalculated. As you are now female, your premium will likely decrease as female drivers are considered lower risk.], [B. We will need to cancel your current policy and set up a completely new one under your new identity. You may be asked for medical information relating to your transition to assess your fitness to drive.], [C. Thank you for informing us. We just need to update your name on the policy to match your driving licence. This is a simple administrative change and will not affect your premium, as gender is not used as a rating factor.], [D. It's not necessary to update us. As long as the driving licence number hasn't changed, the policy is still valid. Informing us will just create unnecessary paperwork for a personal matter.]",C
Gender Reassignment,Customer,General Inquiry,"""Hi, I need to update my details. I've recently transitioned, so I need to change my name and gender marker on my policy from female to male."" [A. Of course. We can get that updated for you. We'll just need to see your updated driving licence. Under UK rules, insurers use gender-neutral pricing, so this change will not affect your premium.], [B. We'll have to recalculate your premium. Male drivers are statistically a higher risk, so your price will go up now that you're listed as male.], [C. Are you sure you want to do that? It might be cheaper to leave it as it is. We can just add a note to the file.], [D. That's a significant change. We'll need a letter from your doctor confirming your transition before we can update our systems.]",A
Gender Reassignment,Customer,Prospective Customer,"""Hi, I'm a long-standing customer and I need to update my personal details on my policy. I've recently transitioned, so I need to change my name and my title from 'Miss' to 'Mr'. I'm just wondering if this will affect my premium?"" [A. Okay, I can update the name. Just so you are aware, changing your gender marker to male will likely increase your premium, as male drivers statistically represent a higher risk.], [B. Of course. We can update your name and title for you. We'll need some documentation for the name change, like a deed poll. The change of gender marker itself won't affect your premium as we use gender-neutral pricing, but we do need to make sure your details match your driving licence.], [C. Right... so you want to be a 'Mr' now. We'll need to see all the official medical paperwork before we can even consider changing that on our system. It's a very complicated process.], [D. Because your identity has fundamentally changed, your old policy will be void. You will need to cancel this policy and take out a brand new one as a new customer, which means you may lose your no-claims discount.]",B
Gender Reassignment,Customer,Current Policyholder,"""Hi, I'm a current policyholder and I need to update my personal details. I've recently transitioned, and my name and gender are now legally recognised as female. What do I need to do to update my policy?"" [A. So you were a man before? We'll need to see your birth certificate and deed poll. Your premium will likely go down as female drivers are statistically safer.], [B. Thank you for letting us know. I can update your name and title on the policy for you. While we will also update the gender marker on our records to reflect your legal status, under current UK regulations this will not have any impact on the price of your insurance.], [C. That's a significant life change. We will have to run a full new quote as your risk profile has completely changed. We'll also need to see some medical confirmation of the change.], [D. It doesn't really matter. As long as the name on your driving licence matches, that's all we need. We don't use gender for pricing anyway, so it's not worth the admin to change it.]",B
Gender Reassignment,Customer,Claimant,"""I've recently gone through gender reassignment from female to male and need to update the details on my policy, including my title and gender marker. How will this affect my insurance premium?"" [A. You'll need to provide us with the updated documentation, like your new driving licence, so we can amend your policy details. Since the introduction of gender-neutral pricing, insurers cannot use gender as a factor in pricing, so changing your gender marker alone will not affect your premium.], [B. Okay, so you're now male. Men under 25 are statistically much higher risk, so if you fall into that age bracket, you should expect your premium to increase significantly.], [C. That's a bit of a complicated change. It might be easier to just wait until your renewal and start a fresh policy with the new details then. It saves a lot of admin fees.], [D. We'll need a letter from your doctor confirming the change before we can do anything. Without that, we can't update our systems and your policy might be invalid.]",A
Gender Reassignment,Customer,General Inquiry,"""Hi, I've recently completed my gender reassignment and need to update my details on my car insurance. What's the process for this?"" [A. That's an unusual one. We'll have to run a whole new quote. Your premium might go up, as our data shows female drivers have more small accidents.], [B. Of course. We can update your name and title on the policy. You'll just need to send us a copy of your new driving licence or a deed poll. Just to reassure you, under UK and EU law, gender is not a factor in calculating insurance premiums, so this change won't affect your price.], [C. Wow, congratulations on your journey. So, are you a better driver now? Just kidding! We'll need to see all your medical records to process this change.], [D. You'll need to cancel your current policy and take out a new one under your new identity. It's the only way to do it properly.]",B
Gender Reassignment,Customer,Prospective Customer,"""Hi, I've recently updated my legal documents following my gender reassignment, and my driving licence now shows my new name and female gender marker. I need to update my car insurance policy. What's the process, and will this affect my premium?"" [A. We can certainly update the name and gender marker on your policy. We'll just need to confirm the details from your updated driving licence. Following a 2012 European Court of Justice ruling, insurers are not permitted to use gender as a risk factor, so this change will not affect your premium.], [B. Of course. Generally, female drivers get cheaper insurance, so this change should work in your favour and lower your premium.], [C. That's a significant medical change. You'll need to declare it as a medical condition and we may require a letter from your GP confirming you are fit to drive before we can amend the policy.], [D. For a change of legal identity, you must cancel your current policy and start a new one from scratch. This will involve a cancellation fee, and you will have to start the quote process again.]",A
Gender Reassignment,Customer,Current Policyholder,"""Hi, I'm a current policyholder. I need to update my details as I've recently transitioned from female to male. How will this affect my insurance premium?"" [A. Thank you for informing us. We can update your title and name on the policy. Since gender is no longer used to calculate insurance prices, your premium will not change. We may just need to see a copy of your updated driving licence or deed poll to make the change.], [B. Okay, we can process that change. Just so you are aware, your premium will increase as male drivers are statistically a higher risk and have more accidents.], [C. That's a very personal matter. We'll need you to send in extensive medical documentation to prove the transition before we can even consider changing your details on our system.], [D. In this situation, the policy will need to be cancelled and a new one started under your new details. This will incur a cancellation fee and you may lose your No Claims Discount.]",A
Gender Reassignment,Customer,Claimant,"""Hi, I need to update my policy. I've recently transitioned from male to female and have legally changed my name and title."" [A. Of course. To update your name and title, we just need a copy of a legal document like a deed poll. This is a simple administrative change and won't impact your premium, as gender is not a factor in UK car insurance pricing.], [B. That's a significant change. Your premium will have to be recalculated as female drivers have a different risk profile. We'll need to run a completely new quote for you.], [C. I'm not sure the system can handle a gender change. It might be easier to just leave the details as they are until you renew, to avoid any administrative headaches.], [D. How lovely for you. Don't you worry about the policy, the most important thing is that you're happy. We can just change the name, that's the main thing isn't it?]",A
Gender Reassignment,Customer,General Inquiry,"""Hi, I've recently changed my name and gender legally. I'm a trans man and I need to update my car insurance details. What's the process?"" [A. Are you sure you want to do that? Changing your gender to male will almost certainly make your insurance more expensive. Maybe it's better to leave the details as they are.], [B. Of course. We can update your personal details on the policy. I'll need your policy number and your new legal name. We'll also update your gender in our system. This may affect your premium, as it's recalculated using the new information, but we'll confirm any change with you before finalising it.], [C. That's quite a big change. We'll need to see a copy of your Gender Recognition Certificate and proof of any medical procedures before we can update our records.], [D. We'll have to cancel your current policy and you'll need to apply for a new one. Policies can't be changed mid-term for something like a gender change as it fundamentally alters the risk profile.]",B
Gender Reassignment,Customer,Prospective Customer,"""I've recently updated my driving licence to reflect my gender reassignment from female to male. I need to update my car insurance policy. Will my premium change?"" [A. We can certainly update your policy to reflect the change on your driving licence. Insurers do use statistical data, including gender, to calculate premiums, so there may be a change in price, which we can confirm for you. To do this, I just need to take a few details.], [B. Right. Well, as you're now legally male, you fall into a higher-risk category. Your premium will definitely increase to reflect that. It's just a fact of life for men and car insurance.], [C. That must have been a difficult process for you. Are you sure you want to update it? If you were assigned female at birth, you probably still have those safer driving instincts, so it might be better to leave it as it is to keep your premium down.], [D. For a change like that, we'd need to see medical proof of your gender reassignment before we can update our systems.]",A
Gender Reassignment,Customer,Current Policyholder,"""Hi, I'm calling to update my details on my policy. I've transitioned, so I need to change my name and update my title from Mr to Ms. How will this affect my insurance?"" [A. Of course, I can update those details for you. In the UK, insurers are not permitted to use gender as a factor when calculating premiums, so this change will not affect the price of your policy. Let's get the new details confirmed.], [B. That's fine. Statistically, female drivers have fewer accidents, so you'll probably see a nice little reduction in your premium at renewal.], [C. We can't change the gender marker halfway through a policy term. You'll have to wait until your renewal and take out a new policy under your new details.], [D. That's a significant change. We'll need to see a letter from your doctor and a copy of your new driving licence before we can update our system.]",A
Gender Reassignment,Customer,Claimant,"""Hi, I've recently transitioned and have updated my driving licence to reflect my new name and male gender. I need to update my car insurance policy."" [A. Right, so you're now male. That means your premium will unfortunately have to go up, as men are statistically higher-risk drivers.], [B. I see. That's a significant life change. We'll need a copy of your Gender Recognition Certificate and a letter from your doctor before we can process any changes to the policy.], [C. Thank you for informing us. I can update your name and title on the policy right away. Can you please confirm the new details for me? The change in gender marker on your licence won't impact the price of your insurance.], [D. Are you sure you want to do that? It might be flagged as fraud if your old and new details don't match up across all databases. It's probably best to leave it as it is until renewal.]",C
Gender Reassignment,Customer,General Inquiry,"""I have recently completed my gender reassignment and have updated my driving licence with my new name and gender. I need to update my car insurance policy. What's the process and will it affect my premium?"" [A. We can update your personal details on the policy. You'll need to provide evidence, such as your updated driving licence or a deed poll. We will then recalculate your premium based on the new information, as gender is one of the factors used in pricing. I can guide you through the process now.], [B. That's a very unusual request. This will be a complex administrative change and will require authorisation from our underwriters. It will likely take several weeks to process.], [C. We can only change the name on the policy. For rating purposes, we are legally required to use the gender you were assigned at birth for the lifetime of your policy with us.], [D. Why do you need to change the gender? As long as the name matches your licence that's all that matters. It won't affect the price either way.]",A
Marriage and Civil Partnership,Customer,Prospective Customer,"""Hi, I've recently gotten divorced and my ex-partner is still a named driver on my policy. What do I need to do?"" [A. Oh, a divorce. That's a shame. Your premium will definitely go up now you're single, insurers see single people as a higher risk. You'll need to remove your ex-partner immediately.], [B. I'm sorry to hear you've been through a divorce. To update your policy, you'll need to inform us of your change in marital status from 'married' to 'single' or 'divorced'. We will also need to remove your ex-partner as a named driver, as they typically no longer have an insurable interest in the vehicle. This may affect your premium, and I can run through the new figures with you.], [C. I see. Was it an amicable split? If they still need to drive the car, you could leave them on, but it's risky if things turn sour. It's usually better to make a clean break.], [D. You don't need to do anything until the policy renews. As long as the payments are being made, the cover remains valid for both of you. Just sort it out at renewal time.]",B
Marriage and Civil Partnership,Customer,Current Policyholder,"""My partner and I have just entered into a civil partnership. I need to update my policy details. Does this change anything regarding our insurance?"" [A. Congratulations on your civil partnership! Yes, this is a change we need to record. Insurers often view partners in a legally recognised relationship as a lower risk, which can sometimes lead to a lower premium. We can also explore a multi-car policy to see if that would be more cost-effective for you both.], [B. A civil what? Is that like being married? It doesn't really matter, the price is the price. Just tell me your new name if you've changed it.], [C. The only thing that matters is who is the main driver. You should put the policy in the name of whoever has the fewest points to get the best price. It's a good way to save money.], [D. It won't make any difference to your policy. It's just a personal life event, not a risk factor for insurance.]",A
Marriage and Civil Partnership,Customer,Claimant,"""Hi, I've recently divorced from my partner and need to sort out my car insurance. He's no longer on the policy. Does my marital status affect my premium?"" [A. I'm sorry to hear you're going through a divorce. Yes, your marital status is one of the factors we use to calculate your premium, along with things like your age, postcode, and driving history. We'll need to update your details on the policy, which may result in a change to the price.], [B. Oh dear, that's a shame. To be honest, newly single people are often seen as a higher risk because they can be more distracted or stressed. Your premium will probably go up.], [C. Right, so you're on your own now. Don't worry, we'll sort it. It's usually the man who handles the car insurance, isn't it? Let's make this simple for you.], [D. No, your marital status makes no difference at all to your insurance premium. The only thing that matters is removing your ex-partner as a named driver.]",A
Marriage and Civil Partnership,Customer,General Inquiry,"""My husband and I currently have separate car insurance policies. Would it be cheaper to combine them into one multi-car policy?"" [A. It can often be cheaper due to multi-car discounts offered by many insurers. However, it's not guaranteed and depends on your individual circumstances, like driving history and the cars you own. The best approach is to get quotes for both a combined policy and two separate ones to see which offers better value.], [B. It really depends on his driving record. If he's had a few accidents, adding him to your policy will definitely make your insurance more expensive.], [C. Yes, a multi-car policy is always the cheapest option. Insurers reward loyalty, so putting everything together will save you a lot of money.], [D. You can only do that if the cars are jointly registered in both your names. Otherwise, it's legally considered 'fronting' and is not allowed.]",A
Marriage and Civil Partnership,Customer,Prospective Customer,"""My husband and I have just separated, and I need to get my own car insurance. I was a named driver on his policy for the last 10 years. Will that experience count for anything?"" [A. That's a shame. You'll find insurance is much more expensive now you're single. Insurers see married drivers as a lower risk, so your premium will go up automatically.], [B. You'll have to ask your ex-husband to legally transfer his No Claims Discount to you as part of your divorce settlement. Once you have the legal document, we can apply it to your new policy.], [C. I understand this can be a difficult transition. While the No Claims Discount (NCD) belongs to the main policyholder, many insurers will take your driving experience as a named driver into account and may offer an introductory discount. I can help you get a quote that reflects this.], [D. No, that experience doesn't count for anything. The No Claims Discount belongs entirely to your husband, so you will be starting from scratch with zero years. Your price will be the same as a new driver.]",C
Marriage and Civil Partnership,Customer,Current Policyholder,"""My partner and I just got married, and I need to update my details. Does this affect my car insurance premium?"" [A. Congratulations on your marriage! Yes, we'll need to update your marital status. This can often lead to a lower premium as insurers statistically view married drivers as a lower risk. Let's update your details and see how it affects your quote.], [B. It won't make any difference to the price, but we have to update it for our records. It's just a box-ticking exercise.], [C. Are you sure you want to declare it? It can sometimes complicate things and might even make your insurance go up if your partner has a poor driving record.], [D. Congratulations! Now that you're married, you're legally required to have a joint insurance policy with your spouse. We'll need to cancel this one and set up a new one for you both.]",A
Marriage and Civil Partnership,Customer,Claimant,"""Hi, I've just gotten married and I want to add my husband to my car insurance. I've heard that married people get cheaper insurance, is that right?"" [A. Congratulations on your marriage! Insurers often view married drivers as a lower risk, which can lead to a reduction in your premium. However, the final price will also depend on your husband's personal details, like his driving history. We can certainly run a quote to see how adding him affects your policy.], [B. Yes, married people always get cheaper insurance, it's a guaranteed discount. It's because you're seen as more responsible now.], [C. You can't just add him to your policy mid-term. You'll need to cancel your current one and take out a brand new joint policy in both your names once this one expires.], [D. It won't make a difference. We only look at individual driving records, so your marital status is irrelevant to the price.]",A
Marriage and Civil Partnership,Customer,General Inquiry,"""My partner and I have just entered into a civil partnership. We both have our own cars and separate insurance policies. Is it worth combining them?"" [A. Congratulations on your civil partnership. It's often possible to get a discount by combining both cars onto a single multi-car policy, and it can simplify your admin too. We can certainly run a quote for you to compare it against your current separate policies to see which is more cost-effective.], [B. You can't combine policies unless you are married. A civil partnership doesn't count for multi-car discounts, so you must keep them separate.], [C. It's always cheaper to have two separate policies. Just tell your current insurers you're in a partnership, that's all you need to do. It won't make much difference to the price.], [D. Oh, a civil partnership! How lovely. You'll definitely want to combine everything now you've made it official, won't you? It's what all committed couples do.]",A
Marriage and Civil Partnership,Customer,Prospective Customer,"""My partner and I are in a civil partnership. We want to get a joint car insurance policy. Is this treated the same as a married couple?"" [A. Yes, for insurance purposes, a civil partnership is treated in the same way as a marriage. You can take out a joint policy and may be eligible for the same discounts.], [B. It's similar, but not exactly the same. The discount for civil partners is usually a bit less than for married couples as the arrangement is seen as less legally binding.], [C. No, you can't get a joint policy. You would each need to take out a separate policy and name the other as an additional driver.], [D. We can do that, but you'll need to provide your civil partnership certificate as proof. We can't proceed without the legal documentation.]",A
Marriage and Civil Partnership,Customer,Current Policyholder,"""Hi, I've just gotten married and I'd like to add my new wife to my policy. How does that work?"" [A. It's an easy change, but be aware that adding a female driver, especially a new wife, will definitely increase the cost significantly.], [B. Congratulations on your marriage! We can certainly add your wife as a named driver. To do that and see how it affects your premium, I'll need some of her details, such as her driving history and licence number.], [C. The easiest way is for her to just get her own insurance policy. It's too much paperwork to add people to an existing one.], [D. You don't need to add her. As you're married, she is automatically covered to drive your car. It's one of the perks.]",B
Marriage and Civil Partnership,Customer,Claimant,"""Hello, my husband passed away recently. He always dealt with the car insurance. The renewal has come through and it's still in his name. I don't know what to do."" [A. I'm very sorry for your loss. I understand this must be a difficult time. We'll need to update the policy details. This will involve creating a new policy in your name, as the original policyholder has sadly passed away. I can guide you through the process of getting a quote now, if you're ready?], [B. Oh dear, that is a pickle. Most husbands handle these things. It's probably best if you ask a son or a brother to help you with this, it can get very complicated.], [C. Don't worry, you can just keep paying the premium as it is. As long as the payments are made, the car is still insured. There's no need to change anything.], [D. You can't drive the car, it's not insured. The policy became invalid the moment your husband passed away. You need to get a new policy immediately or you could face a large fine.]",A
Marriage and Civil Partnership,Customer,General Inquiry,"""My partner and I have just separated, and they were the main driver on our car insurance policy. The car is in my name, but I'm currently a named driver. What do I need to do to take over the policy?"" [A. I'm sorry to hear you're going through a separation. As the policy is in your partner's name, you can't directly take it over. You will need to take out a new policy in your own name. We can help you with a quote for that. It's also worth checking if your partner is willing to transfer the no-claims bonus to you, as this could significantly reduce your premium.], [B. It's simple, we just swap your names over on the policy. Your ex-partner will need to call us to give permission, and then you'll be the main driver.], [C. Oh, that's difficult. It's always messy when relationships end. Who gets to keep the no-claims bonus is usually the biggest fight. You should try and sort that out with them first before calling us.], [D. You'll need a new policy, and I should warn you, your premium will probably go up now that you're single. Insurers view single people as a higher risk than those who are married or cohabiting.]",A
Marriage and Civil Partnership,Customer,Prospective Customer,"""My partner and I have just entered into a civil partnership. We both have our own cars and separate insurance policies. Is there any benefit to telling our insurers or getting a joint policy?"" [A. Congratulations on your civil partnership. Yes, there can be benefits. Insurers often view partnered individuals as a lower risk, which can lead to a discount on your individual premiums, so it's worth informing them. Additionally, you could look into a multi-car policy, which insures both vehicles under one policy and often comes with a significant discount. I can help you explore quotes for both options.], [B. It makes no difference. A civil partnership isn't the same as a marriage in the eyes of an insurer, so your risk profile hasn't changed. You should just keep your separate policies as they are.], [C. Oh, a joint policy? Are you sure? It can get very messy if you two split up. It's probably safer for you both to keep everything separate, just in case.], [D. You have to get a joint policy now. Once you're in a legal partnership, you are required by law to have all your assets, including insurance, linked together. It's a legal requirement.]",A
Marriage and Civil Partnership,Customer,Current Policyholder,"""Hi, my partner and I just entered a civil partnership. We both have our own cars and separate insurance policies. Does our new status change anything, and should we be telling our insurers?"" [A. Congratulations on your civil partnership. You should inform your respective insurers of your change in marital status as it can often result in a lower premium. Partnered individuals are statistically seen as a lower risk. You could also explore a multi-car policy, which might offer further savings.], [B. It makes no difference at all. Your insurance is based on you as an individual driver, so your personal life is irrelevant.], [C. Yes, and you should put both cars on one policy under the main earner's name. It's always cheaper that way.], [D. Congratulations! Don't worry about it now. Your premium won't change until renewal anyway, so just mention it then.]",A
Marriage and Civil Partnership,Customer,Claimant,"""My civil partner passed away recently, and our joint car insurance is due for renewal. What happens now?"" [A. I'm very sorry for your loss. When you're ready, we'll need to update the policy to reflect your new marital status as 'widowed' and remove your partner as a driver. This may change the premium, but I can talk you through the new quote.], [B. You can't continue a joint policy alone. You have to cancel it and take out a brand new one, which means you will lose your no-claims bonus.], [C. I'm sorry to hear that. Unfortunately, your premium is likely to increase significantly now that you are considered 'single' for insurance purposes.], [D. That's very sad. The policy will just run until its end date, and then you can sort out a new one. There's no need to do anything right now.]",A
Marriage and Civil Partnership,Customer,General Inquiry,"""My partner and I have just entered a civil partnership. We have separate car insurance policies at the moment. We were wondering if we should combine them or if there's any benefit to telling our insurers about our new status."" [A. Oh, a civil partnership, that's like being married, isn't it? It won't make any difference to your price, it's just a box-ticking exercise for the forms.], [B. You should definitely get a joint policy. It's what all couples do to save money and it's much less hassle than two separate ones.], [C. Congratulations on your civil partnership. Insurers often view partners in a legally recognised relationship as a lower risk, which can sometimes lead to lower premiums. It would be worthwhile for you both to get quotes for adding each other as a named driver on your respective policies, or to explore a multi-car policy, to see what offers the best value.], [D. I wouldn't bother changing anything until your renewals are due. It's a lot of hassle for a small change and you might even be charged an administration fee for updating your details mid-term.]",C
Marriage and Civil Partnership,Customer,Prospective Customer,"""My husband recently passed away, and I'm now the sole driver of our car. I need to update my insurance policy. What happens now?"" [A. I'm very sorry for your loss. We can update the policy to reflect that you are now the sole registered keeper and main driver. This may change your premium, and we can go through the details together when you're ready.], [B. You'll need to sell the car and get a new policy in your own name. The old policy is void now that one of the named drivers has died.], [C. I'm sorry to hear that. A lot of women find they drive less after their husbands pass. We could reduce your mileage to get the price down for you.], [D. We must have a copy of the death certificate before we can make any changes. You'll need to send that to us by recorded delivery.]",A
Marriage and Civil Partnership,Customer,Current Policyholder,"""My partner and I have just got married. We both have our own car insurance policies with different companies. What's the best way to combine them? Is it cheaper?"" [A. Congratulations on your marriage! You have a couple of options. You could add one of you as a named driver to the other's existing policy, or you could take out a new multi-car policy that covers both vehicles. It's often cheaper to be insured as a married couple as insurers' data shows you're a lower risk. The best approach is to get quotes for both options to see what saves you the most money.], [B. Combining policies, eh? The arguments over money start early! Usually the woman is the better driver, so you should probably just put him on her policy and be done with it.], [C. It's far too complicated to merge policies from different companies. You'll have to wait until they both expire and then start a new one together. Just keep them separate for now.], [D. Now that you're married, you are legally required to have a joint insurance policy. We must cancel both your old policies immediately and start a new one. There will be cancellation fees for both.]",A
Marriage and Civil Partnership,Customer,Claimant,"""My civil partner and I have just moved in together and we want to combine our car insurance. Is it cheaper to add them to my policy?"" [A. Adding your partner as a named driver can often reduce your premium, especially if they have a good driving record, as insurers may see you as a lower risk. It's worth getting quotes for both adding them to your existing policy and for a new joint policy to see which offers the best value.], [B. Are you sure you want to do that? It gets very complicated to separate the policies if you break up. It's much simpler to just keep your own policies.], [C. No, it's always more expensive to add a second person. The risk doubles, so the price doubles. You should keep your policies separate.], [D. It depends who the main driver is. Men are statistically safer drivers so if your partner is a man, you should definitely make him the policyholder to save money.]",A
Marriage and Civil Partnership,Customer,General Inquiry,"""My husband recently passed away, and the car insurance was in his name. What happens to the policy now?"" [A. Don't worry, the policy will automatically transfer to you as the next of kin. You can just carry on as normal until renewal.], [B. I'm sorry to hear that. Did he leave a will? We'll need to see a copy of the death certificate and the will before we can do anything with the policy.], [C. These things are so complicated, aren't they? Perhaps a male family member could help you sort this out? It can be a lot to handle on your own.], [D. I'm very sorry for your loss. The policy in your late husband's name will need to be cancelled as it became void upon his passing. We can help you arrange a new policy in your name to ensure you remain insured. We will need to take some details from you to provide a quote.]",D
Pregnancy and Maternity,Customer,Prospective Customer,"""I'm in my third trimester and about to go on maternity leave. I won't be commuting to work anymore, so my mileage will be much lower. Can this reduce my car insurance premium?"" [A. Yes, a significant reduction in your annual mileage, especially stopping a regular commute, should lower your premium. We can update your policy details now to see what saving you could make.], [B. Are you sure you'll be driving less? Most new mothers are out and about all the time, driving to baby groups and appointments. It probably won't make a difference.], [C. Maternity leave isn't a valid reason to change your policy. Your premium is fixed for the year, you'll have to wait until your renewal.], [D. We can lower the mileage, but because you'll have a baby in the car, the risk factor goes up, so the price will likely stay the same or even increase.]",A
Pregnancy and Maternity,Customer,Current Policyholder,"""Hi, I'm 7 months pregnant and we've just bought a bigger, safer car for when the baby arrives. I need to update my policy. Will my pregnancy affect the premium for the new car?"" [A. Congratulations on your growing family! Changing your car is straightforward. We'll need the details of the new vehicle to calculate the new premium, which will be based on factors like the car's make, model, and insurance group. Your pregnancy itself is not a factor we consider for pricing your car insurance.], [B. Oh, a 'mummy-mobile'! How lovely. Don't worry your head about the details, we'll get it sorted. Is your partner around to handle the boring insurance stuff for you?], [C. Yes, you must declare the pregnancy as it's a material fact. We'll also need to know if you plan to drive close to your due date, as this can be seen as a higher risk and may increase your premium.], [D. Changing your car will definitely change the price. And with a baby on the way, you'll be more distracted, so that's a higher risk. You should expect a significant price hike.]",A
Pregnancy and Maternity,Customer,Claimant,"""I'm on maternity leave and I'm not driving to work anymore, so my mileage has dropped significantly. I've heard you can get a refund if you don't drive as much as you estimated. How does that work?"" [A. We can certainly update your policy details. If you change your class of use from 'commuting' to 'social, domestic and pleasure only' and lower your estimated annual mileage, it may reduce your premium. If a reduction is due, we can process a partial refund for the remaining term of your policy. Shall we look at that for you?], [B. Oh, a new mum, you must have your hands full! It's probably not worth the hassle for the sake of a few pounds. You should just focus on the baby.], [C. Yes, we just need your new mileage and we will send a refund cheque out immediately. It's a standard process for all customers who drive less than they thought.], [D. You'll probably be driving more than you think with a new baby – trips to the doctor, baby groups, visiting family. It's best to leave your mileage as it is to be on the safe side.]",A
Pregnancy and Maternity,Customer,General Inquiry,"""I've just bought a new car seat for my baby. Do I need to tell my car insurance company about it?"" [A. Oh, a new baby, how lovely! Don't you worry your head about insurance forms. Just make sure the little one is strapped in tight. That's the most important thing.], [B. Yes, any change to the car's interior is a modification. You must declare it, and it will probably increase your premium because it changes the car's original factory standard.], [C. No, you don't need to declare a standard, legally-compliant baby or child car seat. They are considered personal possessions and not a vehicle modification. Just ensure it's fitted correctly according to the manufacturer's instructions for safety.], [D. Are you sure you fitted it correctly? Many new parents make mistakes. If you have an accident and it's not fitted right, your insurance might not pay out.]",C
Pregnancy and Maternity,Customer,Prospective Customer,"""I'm pregnant with my first child and due in a few weeks. I'm a bit nervous about driving with a newborn. Do I need to tell my car insurance company once the baby is born?"" [A. Congratulations! You'll be tired, so maybe you should let your partner do all the driving for the first few months to be safe.], [B. Yes, you must add the baby as a named passenger immediately. Failing to do so could invalidate your policy if you have an accident with them in the car.], [C. Congratulations on your upcoming arrival! You don't need to inform us or add your baby to the policy. Your cover automatically extends to any passengers you carry. Just ensure you use a legally compliant, correctly fitted car seat.], [D. Oh, a new mum! You'll probably be distracted when driving. Have you considered a telematics 'black box' policy to monitor your driving and keep you safe?]",C
Pregnancy and Maternity,Customer,Current Policyholder,"""Hi, I'm calling to update my policy details. I've just started my maternity leave, so I'm no longer commuting to work. Will this affect my insurance premium?"" [A. Yes, we can certainly update that for you. Changing your policy's use from including 'commuting' to 'social, domestic, and pleasure only' often results in a lower premium as the perceived risk is reduced. I can process that change now, and it may lead to a partial refund for the remainder of your policy term.], [B. Maternity leave? We'll have to factor in that you might be more distracted now with 'baby brain'. It's a common thing. So while you're not commuting, the risk profile actually stays about the same.], [C. Oh, congratulations! How exciting. Don't you worry your head about things like premiums right now. You've got more important things to think about. We'll just leave it as it is for simplicity's sake.], [D. That's a major life change, so you'll actually need to cancel this policy and take out a new one. We can't just amend the use class mid-term for something like maternity leave.]",A
Pregnancy and Maternity,Customer,Claimant,"""I'm on maternity leave with my 4-month-old baby. I'm worried about what would happen to my baby's car seat if I was in an accident. Are they covered by my insurance?"" [A. Many comprehensive car insurance policies include cover for child car seats, often replacing them after an accident regardless of visible damage. I can check the specific terms of your policy to confirm the level of cover you have.], [B. Oh, you new mothers do worry, don't you? A car seat is just a personal belonging, like a handbag. It's not covered unless you have separate personal possessions cover.], [C. You would need to claim for it under your home insurance as it's a 'contents' item. It's a very complicated process and you'd need a police report to prove the accident happened.], [D. Car seats are tough. Unless it's smashed to bits, it'll be fine. Insurers won't pay out for a few scuffs, so it's not really worth thinking about.]",A
Pregnancy and Maternity,Customer,General Inquiry,"""I'm 32 weeks pregnant. Once the baby arrives, do I need to add them to my car insurance policy as a passenger?"" [A. You don't need to worry about that now, just focus on the baby. Insurance can wait until you're back on your feet.], [B. Yes, it's a legal requirement to add all regular passengers, especially a newborn, to your policy. Failure to do so could invalidate your insurance.], [C. Congratulations on your upcoming arrival! You don't need to add the baby as a named person on your policy as passengers are covered automatically. However, many new parents use this as an opportunity to review their cover to ensure it meets their new family's needs.], [D. A new baby in the car? You'll probably be a much more distracted driver. We might need to review your risk profile after the birth.]",C
Pregnancy and Maternity,Customer,Prospective Customer,"""I'm about to have a baby and I've bought a car seat. If I were to have an accident, would my car insurance cover the cost of replacing it?"" [A. Yes, most comprehensive car insurance policies include cover for child car seats. In the event of an accident, it's recommended to replace the car seat, even if it doesn't look damaged, and your policy should cover the cost up to a specified limit. It's always best to check the exact wording in your policy documents.], [B. Car seats are considered personal belongings, so they wouldn't be covered under your motor policy. You'd need to claim for it on your home contents insurance instead.], [C. Oh, a new baby, how lovely! The most important thing is that the little one is safe. You shouldn't worry about money at a time like this, just focus on buying the safest seat you can.], [D. Only if the car seat was in the car and occupied by the child at the time of the accident. If it was empty, it's not covered.]",A
Pregnancy and Maternity,Customer,Current Policyholder,"""Hi, my car insurance is up for renewal soon. I'm currently 7 months pregnant and plan to start my maternity leave next month. Do I need to update my 'use of car' from 'Social, Domestic, Pleasure and Commuting' now that I won't be driving to work for a year?"" [A. Yes, you should let us know about the change. If you're no longer commuting, changing your policy use to 'Social, Domestic and Pleasure' only will make your policy more accurate and could potentially reduce your premium. We can make that change for you when you renew.], [B. Congratulations! Don't you worry your head about the paperwork. We'll just keep it as it is to save you the hassle, it barely makes a difference to the price anyway.], [C. No, you should leave commuting on the policy. You might need to drive during rush hour for appointments or baby classes, and that's considered commuting, so it's safer to be covered.], [D. You probably won't be driving much at all with a new baby, so it doesn't really matter what the policy says. Everyone's too tired to go anywhere.]",A
Pregnancy and Maternity,Customer,Claimant,"""I'm on maternity leave and won't be commuting for the next year, so my mileage will be much lower. Can this reduce my premium?"" [A. Yes, a change in your car's usage, such as no longer commuting, and a significant reduction in your annual mileage can certainly affect your premium. I can take the new details and recalculate your quote to see what reduction you may be entitled to.], [B. Maternity leave doesn't usually qualify for a discount. In fact, many new mothers are more distracted drivers, so we can't reduce the premium based on that.], [C. Oh, congratulations! Don't you worry about boring insurance details at a time like this. The premium difference will be tiny anyway, it's not worth the hassle of changing it.], [D. You can only change your mileage at the point of renewal, not mid-way through a policy. You'll have to wait until your renewal date to declare the lower mileage.]",A
